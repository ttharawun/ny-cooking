1
cup finely chopped fennel bulb (about ½ a small bulb) or celery
1
cup finely chopped yellow onion (about 1 small)
3
garlic cloves, minced
1
teaspoon dried oregano
½

cup cooked white or brown rice
¼
cup grated Parmesan
2
tablespoons minced fresh parsley, plus more for serving (optional)
1
cup shredded mozzarella, provolone or other semifirm cheese","4034 user ratings","1¼ hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut the peppers in half lengthwise and carefully remove core, seeds and ribs using a paring knife. Arrange the peppers, cut-sides up, in a 9-by-13-inch pan or other baking dish in which they fit snugly.
Step 2
In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the olive oil over medium. Add the fennel and onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic, oregano and red-pepper flakes, and cook until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the beef and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 3 to 5 minutes, until no longer pink.
Step 3
Add ½ cup wine, increase the heat to medium-high and cook, scraping the bottom of the pan, until the liquid in the pan is reduced by about half.
Step 4
Add the tomatoes and their juices, salt and pepper, and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat and stir in the rice, Parmesan and parsley, if using. Taste and adjust seasonings.
Step 5
Divide the mixture among the peppers. Pour the remaining ¼ cup wine into the bottom of the dish, wrap tightly with foil and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until a paring knife easily pierces the peppers. Remove the foil and spoon any juices that have accumulated in the bottom of the pan onto the peppers. Sprinkle the mozzarella evenly onto the peppers and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until the mozzarella is melted and beginning to brown.
Step 6
Allow the peppers to cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with parsley, if using, and serve hot.

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Cook the pasta according to package instructions until al dente.
Step 2
While the pasta cooks, make the sauce: Cut the guanciale into ¼-inch-thick slabs and then 1-inch-long strips. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to a large, deep skillet and heat over medium. Add the guanciale, reduce the heat to low and allow the guanciale to render until crisp, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove the guanciale from the skillet and reserve. Remove 1 tablespoon of the guanciale drippings to a small bowl and set aside.
Step 3
Add the artichokes to the skillet and cook until warmed, stirring carefully so they do not break apart. Stir in the cooked guanciale.
Step 4
Add the egg yolks, the cheese, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper to the small bowl with the reserved guanciale drippings and stir until combined.
Step 5
Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then, using tongs, transfer the cooked pasta to the skillet, mixing to incorporate with the artichokes and guanciale.
Step 6
While whisking, slowly drizzle ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water into the egg mixture until combined.
Step 7
Remove the pasta from the heat and add the egg mixture, tossing vigorously to coat. Add more reserved pasta water incrementally until the sauce is smooth and creamy.
Step 8
Divide the pasta among bowls and top with more grated cheese. If desired, place a raw egg yolk on top of each pasta nest. Top with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, and a drizzle of olive oil to finish.

2
cups canned pineapple juice
1
pineapple (see Tip)
6
packed tablespoons dark brown sugar
6
tablespoons lemon juice (from 2 lemons)
1½
tablespoons Dijon mustard

Freshly ground black pepper or ground cloves","42 user ratings","3½ hours","Step 1
Position a rack near the bottom of the oven and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Using a sharp paring knife, make parallel cuts across the surface of the ham, about a ½-inch deep and 1 inch apart, then repeat in the opposite direction to create a diamond pattern.
Step 2
Place the ham in a large roasting pan, cut side down, and pour over the pineapple juice. Cover the ham with parchment, then cover the pan tightly with foil. Bake until the ham is heated through, 2 to 2½ hours. The internal temperature should reach 135 degrees, which takes about 15 minutes per pound.
Step 3
While the ham cooks, trim the top and bottom off the pineapple, then cut off the peel. Halve the pineapple from top to bottom, then slice into ½-inch-thick half moons. Using a small circular cookie cutter or small knife, cut out and discard the core.
Step 4
Carefully remove the ham from the oven and raise the temperature to 425 degrees.
Step 5
Uncover the ham and ladle out 2 cups of the liquid into a large skillet. Add the brown sugar, lemon juice, mustard and a few generous grinds of black pepper or a pinch of cloves to the skillet and bring to a boil over high heat to make the glaze. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the glaze is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 6
Scatter the pineapple around the pan. Using a spoon or a brush, apply half of the glaze all over the surface of the ham and some over the pineapple slices. Bake, uncovered, until the glaze is bronzed, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer the ham to a cutting board to rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving with the pineapple and extra glaze.
In some markets, you can buy fresh pineapple already peeled, cored and sliced in the refrigerated produce section. You can use that as a shortcut here or prepare a pineapple as detailed in step 3.

(2-pound) slab skin-on pork belly
1
tablespoon Shaoxing wine
2
scallions, tied into a knot
1
(2-inch) piece fresh ginger, unpeeled and sliced
1
dried star anise (optional)
1
teaspoon whole black peppercorns (optional)
½
tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons fine sea salt
½
teaspoon five-spice powder
¼
teaspoon ground white pepper
¼
teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
½
teaspoon white vinegar

English mustard, to taste","9 user ratings","2 hours, plus 24 hours’ resting and drying","Step 1
In a large pot, combine the pork belly with enough water to cover it by 1 inch. Add the Shaoxing wine, scallions, ginger, star anise (if using) and whole black peppercorns (if using); bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the meat is soft and tender, about 1 hour. Poke the meat (not the skin) with a chopstick; the juices should run clear. Take it out of the pot and let it cool down.
Step 2
In a small bowl, combine ½ tablespoon of the fine sea salt with the five-spice powder, white pepper and ground ginger (if using). When the pork belly is cool enough to handle, flip the pork belly over so that the skin faces down. Rub the seasoning all over the flesh side, leaving the skin unseasoned.
Step 3
Make a tray out of aluminum foil, just large enough to hold the pork belly, and place the pork belly inside, skin side up, making sure all four sides of the meat are completely covered with the foil. Only the skin of the pork belly should be exposed. WIth a meat tenderizer tool or a sharp fork, poke multiple shallow holes all over the skin of the pork, making sure not to puncture too deeply into the meat below. Brush the skin with the white vinegar. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons of the salt on top.
Step 4
Let the pork rest in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least 18 hours and up to 24 hours. This will dry out the skin even further.
Step 5
Take the pork belly out and let it come to room temperature, about 1 hour. The skin needs to be completely dry and leathery. If it’s not, blot it gently with a paper towel and blow it dry with a hair dryer.
Step 6
Heat the broiler to its highest setting. If you don’t have a broiler, heat the oven to 450 degrees, preferably with the oven fan on.
Step 7
Place the pork belly still nestled in its aluminum foil tray (this ensures that the meat doesn’t overcook) on a wire rack set on top of a baking sheet to catch any drippings. If you’re using a broiler, cook the pork belly on the middle rack. If you’re not using a broiler, cook the belly on the second-to-top rack. Roast until the skin begins to crisp up and bubble, 15 to 30 minutes if using a broiler and 40 to 50 minutes if just using the oven. Keep an eye on the skin to make sure it does not burn. If parts of the skin begin to get too dark, rotate the pork in the oven so that it cooks more evenly.
Step 8
Take the pork belly out of the oven and remove it from its aluminum foil tray. Let it cool down completely before cutting into it, about 1 hour. Flip the pork belly over, skin side down, and slice into 1-inch pieces. Serve immediately, with English mustard as a dipping sauce.

1
small cucumber, cut into 1-inch squares
½
small yellow onion, sliced
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
⅛
teaspoon white pepper

Chopped cilantro, for garnish","0 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup water with the vinegar, tomato paste, mirin, soy sauce and chile. Stir to combine; set aside.
Step 2
Prepare the fish: In a medium baking dish, place the sea bass and pour the rice wine over. Stuff the scallions and ginger into the belly of the fish and let rest for 20 minutes, turning occasionally.
Step 3
Discard the ginger, scallions and rice wine. Holding the knife at an angle, slice three parallel diagonal slashes crosswise on both sides of the fish, deep enough so that they reach the center bone. Next, slice three slashes lengthwise on both sides of the fish, creating a grid pattern.
Step 4
Put ¼ cup of the sweet potato starch on a plate. Press the fish into the starch until both sides are fully coated; rub the starch into the cuts.
Step 5
In a wok set over medium-high heat, heat the oil until it reaches 320 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Shake off any excess starch on the fish. Slide in the fish and cook, flipping twice, until it’s crispy with a golden-brown crust, 5 to 7 minutes. To check if the fish is done, pierce the thickest part of the fish with a chopstick. If it slides right through, it’s done. Turn off the heat. Transfer the fish to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Safely discard the oil, reserving 1 tablespoon of the oil in the wok.
Step 6
Heat the wok over high and add the chopped red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, cucumber, onions, salt and white pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are vibrant and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and rapidly simmer until the sauce is slightly thickened and the bell peppers are soft, 3 to 4 minutes.
Step 7
In a small bowl, whisk the remaining ½ tablespoon sweet potato starch with ½ tablespoon water to form a slurry. Immediately pour the slurry slowly into the wok, stirring so that it’s incorporated completely. The sauce will thicken and begin to glisten. Turn off the heat.
Step 8
Arrange the fried fish on a large rimmed serving plate and pour the sauce with the vegetables over the fish. Garnish with the cilantro; enjoy while hot.
Thick sweet potato starch is coarse, similar to panko bread crumbs but a bit finer. It will give the fish a particularly crispy, crunchy texture.

Put the onions and oil in a large frying pan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until the onions are golden brown and very soft.
Step 2
Meanwhile, put the eggs in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 8 minutes, until hard-boiled. Drain the eggs and run under cold water until cool enough to handle. Next, tap each egg on the side of the sink until cracked all over, then peel under cold running water. Transfer the peeled eggs to a medium serving bowl. Coarsely mash the eggs with a fork.
Step 3
When the onions are caramelized, transfer them to the eggs with a slotted spoon, leaving most of the oil in the pan. Gently mix with your hands or a fork or spoon; you should still be able to distinguish the egg bits from the onions. Season generously with salt and pepper. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little oil from the pan. The mixture should stick together if pressed with your fingers, but should not be oily. Sprinkle with herbs before serving warm or at room temperature.

Homemade or store-bought fried matchstick potatoes (optional; see Tip), for garnish","48 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Prepare the noodles: Toast the penne in a dry, shallow pan, without oil, over medium heat. (Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, or the noodles won’t toast evenly; separate into batches if necessary.) Using a spatula or tongs, move the penne back and forth so they toast on all sides, until they are just a shade shy of golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep stirring as the noodles continue to darken. Set aside.
Step 2
Make the peanut purée: In a blender, purée the peanuts and 1½ cups water, starting on low speed and increasing the speed as needed. Add another 1 cup water and blend until creamy. Set aside.
Step 3
Prepare the soup: Heat the oil in a 6-quart (or larger), heavy-bottomed pot over medium. Add the carrots, celery, onion, green bell pepper and bay leaf and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.

Add the water or stock, peanut purée, garlic, serrano chile, both types of bouillon cubes, salt, cumin, dried quilquiña, locoto powder (if using) and nutritional yeast, plus half the parsley and half the cilantro. Stir until well mixed.
Step 5
Bring to a low boil while stirring constantly, so the peanut purée doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Continue to cook at a low boil, stirring frequently, for 7 minutes. (Keep an eye on the pot, as the soup can boil over quickly.) Add the potato and the toasted pasta then reduce the heat and let simmer until the potato is cooked through and the pasta is just tender, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring in the peas and the remaining parsley and cilantro halfway through. (The soup should have some body, but should not be as thick as a chowder. If necessary, add a little more water or vegetable stock to thin it to the desired consistency.) Discard the bay leaf.
Step 6
Serve the soup in bowls and top with the matchstick potatoes, if using, and parsley to taste, for a touch of brightness and color.
Quilquiña (also known as Bolivian coriander and papalo) is an aromatic herb with a taste akin to cilantro, but stronger. Locoto (also known as rocoto) powder is made from locoto chiles, which are fruity and more potent than jalapeños, ranging in heat level from cayenne to habanero. Quilquiña and locoto powder can be found in Latin markets or ordered from specialty grocers online.
To make matchstick potatoes, julienne 1 peeled russet potato and fry in ½ inch neutral oil over medium-high heat until golden brown and crisp, turning occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes. Dust with salt.

½
cup dry white wine
1½
cups/10 ounces arborio rice
2½
ounces finely grated Parmesan (about 1¼ cups, packed), plus more for serving (optional)","7 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Prep the carrots: If you’ve got a food processor, roughly chop ¾ pound carrots. Add them to the bowl of your food processor; pulse until they form very small, confetti-like flecks no larger than ¼-inch big ((you should have about 2 cups); set aside. (You can also coarsely grate the carrots using a box grater.) Slice the remaining 1½ pounds carrots on a sharp diagonal about ¼-inch thick; transfer to a baking sheet. Toss the sliced carrots with 2 tablespoons chile crisp. (If your chile crisp is predominantly crunchy bits, you can thin it with a little canola or vegetable oil, if needed.) Season the carrots generously with salt and pepper and bake until tender, about 15 minutes, stirring halfway through.
Step 2
Add the stock to a lidded saucepan (any size that will hold it will do); cover and warm over low.
Step 3
In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Add the uncooked carrots, shallot, garlic and coriander; season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until very fragrant, 2 minutes.
Step 4
Add the wine to the carrot mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes.
Step 5
Stir the rice into the carrot mixture, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add 1 cup warmed stock and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid is almost absorbed, about 3 minutes. Repeat 4 more times, adding warm liquid and stirring until absorbed.
Step 6
Once the rice is tender and creamy and all the stock has been absorbed, add the cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter; stir vigorously to combine until the risotto feels silky, creamy, luxurious. Season the risotto to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 7
Divide risotto among shallow bowls or plates and top with the roasted carrots. Serve with additional chile crisp, for drizzling on top.

Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Drain the liquid from the tofu and cut crosswise into 8 rectangular cutlets. Pat dry and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 2
Put flour on a plate. Beat together egg and milk in a shallow medium bowl. Sprinkle bread crumbs on a rimmed baking sheet.
Step 3
Working one at a time, dip a slice of tofu in the flour, lightly coating all sides. Place in the bowl with egg mixture. Lift slice from egg mixture and set on crumbs in a single layer. Shower the top layer with crumbs and flip to coat well. Repeat with remaining slices. If not using right away, refrigerate, uncovered for up to 4 hours, until ready to cook.

Make the panna cotta: In a small saucepan, heat the half-and-half over medium-low until it just begins to simmer. Turn off heat. Add sugar, stir to dissolve, then add orange peel, salt and almond extract, and let steep while you prepare the rest of the recipe.
Step 2
Meanwhile, put gelatin in a small bowl and add 3 tablespoons cold water. Let dissolve, mashing with a spoon to prevent lumps, about 5 minutes. Add to the half-and-half mixture and whisk well to incorporate.

1
tablespoon baking powder
2½
teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1¾ teaspoons fine sea salt
1¼
cups/300 grams cold buttermilk

Melted butter and flaky sea salt (both optional), for finishing","207 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Heat oven to 375 degrees and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.
Step 2
Coarsely grate the butter onto a plate, then freeze until cold and hard, at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the butter to the dry ingredients. Using a spoon, toss together until all of the butter is coated with flour.
Step 3
Add half the buttermilk and toss with the spoon. When incorporated, add the rest of the buttermilk and gently toss again, without mashing together or overmixing, until the dry ingredients are lightly hydrated throughout. The mixture will be crumbly.
Step 4
Flour a clean surface and dump the mixture directly onto it. Using your hands, gently press the crumbs together and then use a floured rolling pin or empty wine bottle to roll the mass gently but firmly into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Fold the dough in half: Using a bench scraper, lift the top half off the surface and fold it over the bottom half. This step may be crumbly and messy at first, but just go for it and fold what you can down from the top. Repeat this roll-and-fold motion 5 times, flouring the surface and dough as needed and using the bench scraper to straighten the edges as needed. The dough will come together as you roll it. Rotate the mixture after each fold to create a square.
Step 5
Build the final layer: Fold the dough in half one last time, then roll to about 1½ inches thick to create a 6-inch square, using the bench scraper to straighten out the edges.
Step 6
Using the bench scraper or a sharp knife, cut straight down into the square to create a 3-by-3 grid of 9 squares, then place them on your sheet pan, upside down if you’d like taller biscuits. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until risen, golden brown on top, and slightly pale on the sides. Don’t worry if a couple of the biscuits tip over or if melted butter pools underneath. Brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if using.

In a large pot or Dutch oven, warm the oil over high heat. Add the onion, garlic and salt and cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are softened and just starting to brown, 5 minutes. (Decrease the heat to medium-high if necessary to prevent scorching.)
Step 2
Decrease the heat to medium-high and add the chicken, rosemary, oregano, red-pepper flakes and several generous grinds of black pepper. Cook, breaking up the chicken into crumbles, until the meat starts to lose its translucent pinkness and is turning white, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and stir well to combine. Add the chicken broth and half the lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom. Bring to a rolling boil and then lower the heat to maintain a very brisk simmer. Simmer until the potatoes are nearly tender, 15 minutes.
Step 3
Add the spinach and dill, to taste. Continue to simmer briskly until the potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes more. Taste and add some or all of the remaining lemon juice, as well as more salt and pepper, if desired. Serve in bowls topped with feta and crushed pita chips.

Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium. Add the tomato paste, garlic, anchovies, red-pepper flakes and rosemary. Stir until the tomato paste is a shade darker and sticking to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 4 minutes. If you have some white wine open, add ½ cup and simmer until nearly all evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes.
Step 2
Add the chicken and tomatoes and season generously with salt. If using whole tomatoes, break them up with your spoon. It may not seem like a lot of liquid, but the chicken will give off juices in time. Bring to a boil over medium-high, then reduce heat to gently simmer over medium-low until the chicken’s cooked through and the sauce is flavorful, 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Step 4
When the chicken is ready, turn off the heat under the sauce. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain the pasta. While the pasta’s cooking, remove the rosemary from the sauce. Using two forks, shred the chicken right in the pot. Taste and adjust with salt. Return to medium-low to keep warm and thicken slightly until the pasta is ready. (Some chicken is so juicy that the sauce might seem thin; just simmer it until it’s thickened.)
Step 5
Add the pasta to the sauce and toss assertively over medium-high until the pasta is well coated. Add pasta water as needed to help the sauce cling to the pasta. Serve with grated Parmesan on top.

ounces dried rice noodles (¼-inch wide)

Bean sprouts and fresh basil leaves, for serving

Lime wedges, hoisin and Sriracha, for serving","56 user ratings","1 hour 20 minutes","Step 1
Trim the brown root ends off the onions, but keep the clean part of the root intact. Quarter the onions lengthwise with their skins on and through the roots so the wedges stay connected. Trim the stems off the cilantro and tie with kitchen string; save the leaves with tender stems for serving. Trim and reserve both ends of the jalapeño; thinly slice the remaining chile and save for serving.
Step 2
Toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon and peppercorns in a large pot over medium heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Place the onions, ginger and reserved jalapeño ends in the pot, raise the heat to medium-high and char, turning occasionally, until evenly charred, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the spice bowl.
Step 3
Add the chicken, 1 tablespoon salt and 6 cups water to the pot and raise the heat to high. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Skim off and discard the foam and dirty bits on the surface.
Step 4
Add the spices and charred vegetables to the pot, along with the sugar, fish sauce and cilantro stems. Cover almost all the way and simmer gently on the lowest heat setting possible until the chicken is cooked through, about 35 minutes.
Step 5
Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a sieve and rinse under cold water to help keep the meat from turning gray and to make it cool enough to handle. Slip the meat off the bones and place the meat in a bowl (it’s OK if some meat remains on the bones). Return the bones and skin to the broth. When it returns to a simmer, taste and add more fish sauce or salt if needed. The broth should be intensely flavorful, bordering on salty, because the rice noodles will temper its savoriness. To prepare this dish ahead, you can strain the broth and refrigerate it and the chicken meat in separate containers for up to 5 days.
Step 6
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until pliable but not soft all the way through, about a minute less than the package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water until cool, then return to the pot. Add the chicken meat and pour in the broth through a sieve. Bring to a boil over high heat, then divide among serving bowls. Top with the bean sprouts, basil and cilantro sprigs and serve with the lime wedges, jalapeño slices, hoisin and Sriracha for seasoning to taste.

½
teaspoon Chinkiang (black) vinegar or balsamic vinegar
¼
teaspoon ground white or black pepper
¼
cup chopped cilantro leaves (optional)","224 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the chicken rice: Mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, sugar, pepper and scallion whites in a large bowl. Slice the chicken alongside the bone, cutting off 2 pieces of meat per thigh. Cut those pieces into 1 ½-inch chunks and add to the bowl, along with the 4 thigh bones that still have some meat on them. Mix well to coat, then cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 day.
Step 2
Rinse the rice in a strainer until the water runs clear. Spread in a large clay pot, a Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet with a lid and add 2 cups hot tap water. Let stand for 15 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, prepare the serving sauce: In a small bowl, stir the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, vinegar and pepper until the sugar dissolves.
Step 4
Spread the chicken with its marinade in an even layer over the rice, nestling the bones into the rice. Scatter the lop cheong evenly over the chicken. Cover and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and continue cooking until the chicken and rice are cooked through, 25 to 35 minutes. Taste a grain of rice to see if it’s tender and cut into a piece of chicken to make sure it has lost its pinkness.
Step 5
Uncover the pot and raise the heat to high. Cook until you hear the rice crackling against the bottom and smell its toastiness, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Step 6
To serve, drizzle a spoonful of the serving sauce over the chicken and gently fold into the rice without scraping up the bottom. Sprinkle with the scallion greens and cilantro, if using, and serve with the remaining sauce. After most of the dish has been eaten, use a thin spatula to scrape up the charred rice on the bottom. It comes off more easily after the pot has cooled a bit.

Grease a round 9-inch springform pan using the remaining 1 tablespoon butter; heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grab chilled cheese wedges and cut 30 pieces of cheese (about ½ teaspoon each). Once the dough has doubled in size, cut the dough into two equal portions. Take one half of the dough and roll it out into a thick rope. Cut the rope crosswise into 15 equal sections. Take one of the cut pieces of dough, roll it into a ball then flatten it into a disk and place 1 piece of cream cheese in the middle. Pinch the dough closed at the top and roll it into a ball using the palms of your hands. Once it’s round, place it into the greased pan, arranging it with its smoothest side up, and repeat the process with the remaining dough. Make sure the balls of dough are equally spaced out, and allow the dough to rise, covered, for 15 minutes.
Step 3
After the second rise, brush the dough with an egg wash of the remaining egg beaten with a splash of whole milk, then bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
Step 4
When the rolls have finished baking, take them out of the oven and drizzle condensed milk on top. Finish off with a sprinkle of coconut flakes. Enjoy warm. Rooti farmaajo can last 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.

4 to 5
cloves of garlic, peeled
1
handful of cilantro leaves, roughly chopped
2½
teaspoons Vegeta seasoning
½
small green bell pepper, halved and sliced","18 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Make the soor: Into a medium saucepan with a lid, pour 3 cups of cold water and add the salt. Turn your heat to medium-high and whisk in your cornmeal slowly to reduce lumps. Cook, whisking constantly, until the soor thickens, about 8 minutes. Cover the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 25 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until thick. If the soor is sticking to the bottom, stir in ¼ cup of water. Set aside, covered.
Step 2
Prepare the dalac bilaash: While the soor cooks, over medium-high heat, warm up oil in a medium pot or skillet. Once the oil is hot, stir in your onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.
Step 3
Add tomatoes and jalapeño (if using), then cover, occasionally mashing the tomatoes as they cook down, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, smash the garlic in a mortar and pestle. Add the cilantro to the smashed garlic and pound until it reduces to a chunky paste.
Step 4
Once the tomatoes have broken down completely, add the cilantro paste, Vegeta seasoning and green bell pepper. Stir to combine, cover, and cook over medium until peppers are soft but not mushy, about 15 minutes.
Step 5
Divide the soor among plates and top with dalac bilaash.

cups/700 milliliters heavy cream, chilled
½
cup/50 grams confectioners’ sugar
4
teaspoons instant espresso powder
1
teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼
teaspoon ground nutmeg

Pinch of fine salt
1
(9-ounce) sleeve chocolate wafer cookies

Cocoa powder (optional), to garnish","96 user ratings","25 minutes, plus chilling and freezing","Step 1
Line a 9-by-5-inch inch loaf pan with 2 crossed strips of plastic wrap that hang generously over all 4 sides.
Step 2
Add the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, espresso powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt to a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to whip the mixture to soft peaks.
Step 3
Scoop about 2 cups of the cream mixture into the loaf pan and smooth into an even layer.
Step 4
Scoop a heaping tablespoon of cream onto one side of each wafer cookie and layer them tightly into the loaf pan from one long side of the pan to the other, creating 3 to 4 rows of about 10 cookies each. (The cookies should be standing upright on their round edges, so when you cut into the finished cake crosswise, you’ll get a nice striped pattern.) You may also have a few extra cookies.
Step 5
Spoon the remaining cream over the top of the cookies, making sure to spread the cream all of the way to the edges of the pans. Tap the pan lightly on the counter to help the cream settle in between the cookies. If you have any cookies remaining, you can place them, flat in one layer, over the top of the cream.
Step 6
Wrap the cake tightly in the overhanging plastic wrap, press gently and refrigerate at least overnight and up to 2 days. Freeze for 1 hour before serving for easier slicing.
Step 7
When you are ready to serve, unwrap the top of the cake and turn it out upside-down onto a serving platter. Remove the plastic wrap and lightly drag a spoon over the cake in a decorative pattern. Dust with cocoa powder, if using. Slice crosswise and serve. Wipe the knife in between cuts for the tidiest slices. If the cake is slightly frozen, let it warm up a bit before serving. You can also scoop it from the pan with a spoon for more casual serving.

½
teaspoon fine salt

Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
10
tablespoons/142 grams unsalted butter, cold and cut into cubes, plus more for greasing the pan
1

ounces/450 grams cream cheese, softened to room temperature
½
cup/100 grams granulated sugar

Finely grated zest of 2 lemons plus ¼ cup freshly squeezed juice

Pinch fine salt
2
large eggs","155 user ratings","1¼ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat oven to 375 degrees.
Step 2
Make the crust: Combine the flour, confectioners' sugar, salt and lemon zest in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade; pulse a few times to combine. Scatter the cubed butter on top, then pulse until the butter is almost completely incorporated and the mixture is sandy. Add the egg yolk and pulse until incorporated. The dough should hold together easily. If not, pulse in up to 3 teaspoons of cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Alternatively, you can mix the dough in a large bowl, using your fingers or a pastry blender to mix the butter into the flour.
Step 3
Lightly butter a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press the dough mixture evenly on the bottom and up the sides of the pan using a lightly floured straight-sided measuring cup to help press the dough into the corners of the pan. (If you need to trim extra dough to make it level with the edge of the pan, reserve it to repair any cracks after the shell has baked.)
Step 4
Line the tart shell with a piece of aluminum foil, making sure to tuck it into the corners and over the edges. Set the tart shell on a baking sheet and bake the shell for 25 to 30 minutes or until the dough appears dry and lightly golden. If the dough puffs up while baking, gently press it back into the pan with an offset spatula or similar tool. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees. If necessary, repair any cracks with the remaining raw dough before filling.
Step 5
While the shell cools slightly, make the filling: Add the cream cheese, granulated sugar, lemon zest and salt to a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to whip the cream cheese mixture until smooth and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until completely incorporated before adding the next, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, if needed. Add the lemon juice and mix until smooth. Tap the bowl on the counter a few times then stir a few times with a rubber spatula to release any large air bubbles.
Step 6
Pour the mixture into the warm crust, smooth the top and carefully transfer the pan, still on the baking sheet, into the oven. Bake until just set around the edges and slightly wiggly in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 7
Let the tart cool to room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely. Remove the outer ring and slice with a warm knife, wiping the knife with a towel in between cuts for the tidiest slices. Serve cold or at room temperature. This keeps well in the fridge, covered for a few days.

"Chicago Thin-Crust (Tavern-Style) Pizza With Sausage and Giardiniera","American,Pizza And Calzones,Italian Sausage,Mozzarella,Parmesan,Party,Pecorino Romano,Pizza Dough,Plan Ahead,Project,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 2 (14-inch) pizzas","For Each Pizza
¾
cup mild or hot giardiniera (see Tips)

Semolina or cornmeal, for dusting
1
stretched, cured Chicago thin-crust (tavern-style) pizza dough skin
¾ to 1
cup pizza sauce for Chicago thin-crust, more or less to taste, or use store-bought pizza sauce
2
ounces finely shredded or powdered Pecorino Romano or Parmesan
8 to 12
ounces full-fat low-moisture mozzarella, shredded, more or less to taste (see Tips)
½
recipe (about 8 ounces) Chicago-style Italian sausage, or use store-bought (raw bulk sausage or raw cased sausage with casings removed)","256 user ratings","35 minutes, plus at least 3½ hours for the dough","Step 1
At least 45 minutes before baking, set a baking steel or stone (larger than 14 inches, see Tips) on an oven rack in the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 500 degrees. Drain excess oil from the giardiniera in a fine-mesh strainer, tossing to get as much off as possible. Discard the oil and set aside the giardiniera.
Step 2
When the oven is heated and you’re ready to bake, dust a pizza peel with semolina or cornmeal. Lift cured pizza skin with the parchment or butcher paper still attached. The top (exposed) side will be drier than the underside. Place the pizza skin on the peel with the drier side facing down (so the papered side faces up). Peel off the parchment paper or butcher paper and discard. Using a fork, poke the crust all over to prevent large bubbles from forming.
Step 3
Spread the sauce evenly over the entire surface of the pizza, all the way to the edges. Sprinkle with half the Romano or Parmesan. Spread the mozzarella evenly over the entire surface, spreading it all the way to the edges. Use your fingertips to dollop marble-size pieces of the raw sausage all over the pizza. Sprinkle with the giardiniera.
Step 4
Give the pizza peel a few shakes to make sure the pizza is still loose (if it sticks at all, using a metal spatula or pizza peel to loosen it), then transfer the pizza to the heated baking steel or stone. Bake until the pizza is as done as you like it. (If you like yours browned and bubbly in the center and lightly charred at the edges, that’ll be about 10 minutes, depending on your oven.) You can use a metal pizza peel to lift the edges of the pizza and peek underneath as it bakes to ensure the bottom is done to your liking.
Step 5
Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and sprinkle immediately with the remaining Romano or Parmesan. Allow to rest for 3 minutes, cut into 1½- to 2-inch squares, and serve immediately. Let the oven reheat for at least 10 minutes before baking subsequent pizzas.
This style of pizza works best with minimal toppings–two to three items max. Sausage and giardiniera is a classic combination in the Chicago area. I like using J.P. Graziano hot giardiniera, which is available by mail order.
Do not use Italian-style (fresh) mozzarella for this pizza. If you cannot find full-fat low-moisture mozzarella, use a combination of widely available part-skim low-moisture mozzarella and shredded Monterey Jack. The cheeses will melt better if you grate them yourself, but pre-shredded can be used in a pinch.
If you do not have a baking stone or steel at least 14 inches square, 12-inch pizzas can also be baked on smaller stones or on the back of a large overturned aluminum sheet tray set on an oven rack while the oven heats. Follow the recipe for 12-inch pizza dough balls as outlined in the Tip for the Chicago thin-crust (tavern-style) pizza dough.

"Chicago Thin-Crust (Tavern-Style) Pizza Dough","American,Pizza And Calzones,Bread Flour,Dough,Instant Yeast,Make Ahead,Plan Ahead,Project","Yield: 2 (14-inch) crusts","300
grams bread flour (about 2¼ cups, see Tips)
7
grams sugar (about 1½ teaspoons)
7

1
gram instant yeast (about ¼ teaspoon)
150
grams cold water (150 milliliters, about ⅔ cup)
30
grams neutral oil, such as light olive oil, vegetable oil or corn oil

Semolina or cornmeal, for dusting","252 user ratings","30 minutes, plus at least 3 hours’ and up to 5 days’ resting","Step 1
Make the dough: Combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer (see Tips). Whisk together to combine, then add the water and oil. Mix at low speed with the dough hook attachment, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, until the dough comes together in a shaggy ball. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Mix on medium-low speed until the dough is silky and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.
Step 2
Divide the dough: Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into two even pieces, about 250 grams each. Using lightly floured hands, shape each piece into a smooth ball, then lightly coat each with oil, using your hands to cover every surface. Transfer each ball to a quart-size zipper-lock bag or other sealable container at least three times its volume. (Quart-size plastic deli containers also work for this.)
Step 3
Ferment the dough: For good results, let the dough rest at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 3 hours. For better results, refrigerate the dough overnight. For best results, refrigerate the dough for at least 3 and up to 5 days.
Step 4
The day before baking, roll the dough: Transfer one dough ball to a work surface generously dusted with semolina or cornmeal. (Refrigerated dough can be rolled straight out of the fridge, though allowing it to rest covered for 1 hour at room temperature will make rolling easier.) Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a very thin circle 14 inches in diameter, lifting and rotating it occasionally (use a ruler or measuring tape to ensure the right size). Repeat with the second ball. If the dough feels like it keeps bouncing back as you try and stretch it, cover it with an inverted bowl or a clean kitchen towel, let it rest for half an hour, then try rolling again.
Step 5
Cure the dough: Transfer the doughs to a flat surface lined with parchment paper or butcher paper. Allow to rest uncovered at room temperature overnight. The top surface of the dough should end up dry to the touch with a leathery feel. If they puff at all during curing, you can push any bubbles with a fork and push them down to flatten them.
For this recipe, you’ll want an accurate baking scale and enough room to leave your stretched dough out at room temperature for a night. Using a scale to measure your ingredients is strongly advised here — at the very least for the flour. Going without can throw off the hydration level of your dough, and by extension, the success of your dough.
If you want to make 2 (12-inch) pizzas instead, use 225 grams flour, 5 grams sugar, 5 grams salt, 1 gram yeast, 115 grams cold water and 22.5 grams oil. Use only ¾ of the toppings.
The dough can also be made in a food processor or by hand. To make with a food processor, combine all the ingredients and process until the dough forms a ball that rides around the blades. Continue running the food processor for 30 seconds, then transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and continue as directed in Step 2.
To make by hand, combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, add the oil and water, and stir with a wooden spoon until a stiff, shaggy dough is formed. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, 7 to 10 minutes. Proceed as directed in Step 2.

¼
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
2
tablespoons chocolate sprinkles","737 user ratings","1 hour 30 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Make the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Generously brush a 9-inch round cake pan with oil.
Step 2
In a blender or food processor, finely chop the carrots by pulsing about 6 to 10 times until minced. Add the sugar and pulse until just combined, about 30 seconds. Add the oil and eggs all at once. Pulse until the mixture is combined and looks a bit foamy, 30 seconds. (You can also do this step without a blender or food processor: Grate the carrots into a medium bowl using the fine side of a box grater. Add the sugar, eggs and oil, and use a whisk to combine.)
Step 3
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, and, using a whisk, mix until just combined. Gently mix in the sour cream and pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan. Bake until the sides pull away slightly from the edge of the tin and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 to 50 minutes.
Step 4
Move the cake to a baking rack set in a sheet pan and let it cool slightly in the pan, about 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto the baking rack and let cool completely.
Step 5
While the cake cools, make the brigadeiro topping: In a small saucepan, combine the sweetened condensed coconut milk, cocoa powder and salt. Stir with a whisk over medium-low heat until the cocoa powder is fully incorporated. Increase heat to medium and simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture forms large bubbles and thickens, about 12 to 15 minutes. It should fully coat a heatproof rubber spatula and drizzle off in a slow stream. Remove from heat and allow the topping to cool completely, stirring frequently to prevent a skin forming on top, and until the brigadeiro topping streaks when stirred and is thick and fudgy, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Step 6
Spread the cooled topping over the cake, swirling the topping over the center and allowing it to drip over the edge. Let it set slightly, about 10 minutes, then shower a handful of chocolate sprinkles over the top. Cut the cake in wedges to serve.

burrito-size (9-inch-wide) tortillas

Canola oil, as needed for frying

Basbaas Cagaar (Green Hot Sauce), for serving (optional)","85 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the onion and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Next, add the beef and brown it, breaking down the bigger clumps of meat as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in cilantro, cumin, coriander and salt.
Step 2
In a small bowl, make a paste using the flour and ½ cup water. Next, cut each tortilla into 4 quarters, creating 20 triangular wedges. To make the tortilla pieces pliable, warm 6 or 7 pieces at a time in the microwave for about 10 seconds (or in the oven at 350 degrees).
Step 3
On a clean surface, grab one cut tortilla piece and position the round end closest to you. Form a cone shape by taking the tip at the bottom left and folding it up and over to meet the right edge slightly higher than its middle. Using your finger, brush a little flour paste over the top surface of the folded piece. Lift the bottom right tip of the tortilla and bring it up to cover the folded flap, creating a cone shape. Holding the cone in one hand, fill it with 2 tablespoons of beef filling. Tuck the inner flap to cover and seal in the filling, brush flour paste on the top surface covering the filling and then seal the sambuus by folding the top flap down and pressing to seal, creating a triangular shape. Use the flour paste to fill in gaps. Set on a baking sheet and repeat this process until all of the filling has been used.
Step 4
Pour ½ inch canola oil into a large, deep skillet and heat over medium-high. Once the oil is shimmering hot (you can flick in a small amount of the flour paste and see if it sputters), fry 4 to 6 sambuus at a time until golden brown and crispy, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer sambuus to a paper towel-lined plate to catch excess grease. Serve hot crispy sambuus right away, with hot sauce, if using.
Sambuus are best eaten right after frying, when they’re still hot and crisp. However, if making ahead, you can freeze the uncooked sambuus after assembly, then thaw and fry at your convenience. Frozen sambuus can last several months.

Any combination of chile sauce, rice or black vinegar, toasted sesame oil, white pepper, cilantro and MSG (optional, for serving)","200 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
In a medium bowl, use your hands or two forks to mix together the ground chicken, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, half the garlic, half the ginger, and the red-pepper flakes (if using).
Step 2
Heat your largest nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and the ground chicken, then use a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula to quickly press meat into a thin layer (like one giant smash burger). Cook, undisturbed, until meat is browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Break up meat into bite-size pieces and stir until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, then transfer the chicken to a clean bowl, leaving the juices and fat in the skillet.
Step 3
Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the scallion whites and the remaining ginger and garlic to the skillet. Raise heat to medium-high, scrape up browned bits on the skillet and stir until sizzling and light golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice, peas, the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and salt to taste. Stir to coat in the oil and break up clumps of rice. Spread out the rice along the sides and bottom of the skillet. Cook, undisturbed, until the sound shifts from a sizzle to a crackle and the rice is golden at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. If the rice is burning, add more oil.
Step 4
Pour the eggs in a thin stream over the rice. When you see some of the egg start to set, 15 to 30 seconds, toss the rice constantly to break up and cook the eggs. Add the chicken and toss to warm through, 1 minute. Turn off the heat and stir in the scallion greens. Serve with more soy sauce and other seasonings as you like.
Leftover, cooked rice from the fridge has less moisture, so it will crisp more easily. If you’re starting with uncooked rice, cook it as you would pasta so that the grains are not clumped together: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 1⅓ cups rice and cook until just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes for white rice and 25 to 30 minutes for brown rice. Drain, run under cold water to cool, shake to get rid of any water, then spread out on a baking sheet and refrigerate until Step 4.

"Creamy Meyer Lemon Pasta","Pastas,Dill,Fennel Seed,Garlic,Heavy Cream,Linguine,Meyer Lemon,Spaghetti,Dinner,Easy,Lunch,Quick,Weeknight,Main Course,Side Dish,Spring,Winter,Vegetarian","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","
Salt
1
pound spaghetti or linguine
3
small Meyer lemons (about 8 ounces total), see Tip
3
tablespoons unsalted butter
6
large garlic cloves, sliced thinly
1
teaspoon fennel seeds, coarsely ground
1¼
cups heavy cream
½
cup lightly packed dill leaves and tender stems, very coarsely chopped

Black pepper, for serving","172 user ratings","35","Step 1
Bring a large pot of heavily salted water (about 2 tablespoons kosher salt to about 6 quarts water) to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook, occasionally stirring, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.
Step 2
Meanwhile, trim the tops and bottoms off two of the Meyer lemons and slice into ¼-inch discs, discard any seeds, then very roughly chop into small pebbly pieces. Cut the remaining lemon into wedges for serving.
Step 3
In a large skillet or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the garlic, season with salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chopped lemon pieces and ground fennel seeds, season again with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally until very soft, but not mushy 3 to 5 minutes.
Step 4
Pour in the cream, turn up the heat to medium, bring to a simmer, then add the cooked pasta and toss to coat with tongs. Add about ½ cup pasta liquid, toss again and cook, tossing often, until the sauce thickens but still pools a little at the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. If more sauce is desired, add a little more pasta liquid, toss again and continue cooking until the desired sauciness is reached. Turn off heat, season with salt and stir in dill (reserving some for serving on top)
Step 5
Serve the pasta while hot, sprinkled with reserved dill, freshly ground black pepper and lemon wedges, as desired.
If you cannot find Meyer lemons, regular lemons can work, but be sure to simmer the chopped pieces in salted water for 3 to 5 minutes or until most of the bitterness has gone away.

(15-ounce) can small white beans (preferably navy or cannellini beans), rinsed (or 1⅓ cups cooked white beans)
1
pound orecchiette (or other shaped pasta that will cup or grasp the sauce)

Freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino (optional), for serving","458 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high.
Step 2
In a small bowl, stir together ¼ cup olive oil with the shallot, tomato paste, garlic, rosemary, red-pepper flakes and sugar. On a large baking sheet, toss the tomatoes with the dressing; season generously with salt and pepper, then spread in an even layer.
Step 3
On a second baking sheet, toss the beans with 2 tablespoons olive oil; season generously with salt and pepper.
Step 4
Roast the tomatoes and beans, stirring halfway through, until tomatoes slump and beans crisp, about 25 minutes.
Step 5
While the tomatoes and beans roast, cook the pasta until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water then drain pasta.
Step 6
Transfer the beans and tomatoes to the pot. Add ¼ cup pasta cooking water to the sheet pan from the tomatoes and use a flexible spatula to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the sheet pan; transfer to the pot, then repeat with another ¼ cup pasta cooking water. (One thing they’ll teach you in French culinary school: Never, ever discard the sucs, those browned bits at the bottom of the pan that carry deep flavor.)
Step 7
Add the pasta and the remaining ½ cup olive oil to the pot; stir vigorously until saucy. Season generously with salt and pepper, then add extra pasta water as needed to moisten until glossy. Divide among wide, shallow bowls and top with grated cheese, if desired.

(4- to 6-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, patted dry
1
pint cherry or other small tomatoes
1½
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
3
tablespoons unsalted butter
5
garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated
3
basil sprigs, plus ½ cup torn leaves
8
ounces angel hair pasta","54 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and heat the broiler to high. On a foil-lined sheet pan, coat the salmon and tomatoes with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the salmon skin side up. Broil until the tomatoes are blistered and the salmon’s skin is crisp and flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 10 minutes. Halfway through broiling, check on the sheet pan: If the tomatoes are burning, give them a stir. If the salmon skin is burning — congrats, you have a powerful broiler! — move the rack to the center of the oven and keep cooking.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 3 cups water, 1½ teaspoons Diamond Crystal salt, the basil sprigs and a generous sprinkling of black pepper. Bring to a boil. Add the pasta, breaking the noodles in half if they don’t fit in the skillet. Cook over medium-high, tossing often with tongs or a fork, until the pasta is al dente, 5 to 8 minutes. It’s OK if the water isn’t completely absorbed, but if the skillet looks dry, without any liquid on the bottom of the skillet, add a few tablespoons of water. If the pasta is done before the salmon, remove from heat and cover to keep warm.
Step 3
When the salmon and tomatoes are out of the oven, transfer the salmon to plates, skin side up, to rest. Remove the basil sprigs from the pasta, then add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the pasta and toss until melted and glossing the noodles. Add the tomatoes, any juices from the sheet pan and the basil leaves to the pasta and stir just once to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the salmon alongside the noodles.

2
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
4
(6-ounce) thick white fish fillets, such as halibut or cod (skin on or off)","1171 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the upper part. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, capers, pickles, herbs and Worcestershire sauce. Using a Microplane, finely grate the garlic into the bowl, then grate in the zest of the lemon. (Hold on to the lemon; you’ll use the juice later.) Stir to combine and season the tartar sauce to taste with salt and lots of pepper.
Step 2
In a small bowl, stir together the panko and olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
Step 3
Pat the fish dry on all sides and season lightly all over with salt and pepper. Transfer to a lightly greased or foil-lined sheet pan. Coat the top with a thin layer of the tartar sauce (a scant tablespoon per fillet). Sprinkle the panko evenly on top (about 2 tablespoons per fillet), pressing gently to adhere.
Step 4
Bake the fish on the top rack until almost cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes for fillets ½- to ¾-inch thick (though you should check earlier, if using a thinner fish). An instant-read thermometer should read 125 to 130 degrees when inserted into the thickest part of the fish.
Step 5
Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon juice from the lemon to the tartar sauce and cut the remaining lemon into 4 wedges for serving.
Step 6
When the fish is nearly cooked through, switch the oven to broil. Broil the fish on the top rack until the bread crumbs are golden and the fish flakes easily and registers 140 degrees in the thickest part, 2 to 3 minutes. Eat with a spoonful of tartar sauce, more black pepper and a squeeze of lemon. (Any extra tartar sauce will keep for up to a week in the fridge.)

Flaky salt, for serving (optional)","1753 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil. Add pasta and cook until it is just under al dente, 1 minute less than package directions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, and drain the pasta.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the sauce: Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-low heat until crisp, stirring occasionally to make sure it does not burn, about 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate lined with paper towels. Turn heat to medium and add the tomatoes to the skillet, tossing them to coat in the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper. As the moisture from the tomatoes releases, scrape any browned bits that have accumulated at the bottom of the pan (add a few tablespoons of the pasta water if you need to) and continue to cook until the tomatoes begin to fall apart, about 5 to 7 minutes more. Add half of the cooked bacon back to the skillet and toss to combine.
Step 3
Increase the heat to medium-high and add the pasta directly to the skillet tossing to coat with the sauce. Add the arugula and ¼ cup of the pasta water, and carefully toss (you'll have a very full pan) until the arugula wilts. Add the cheese and another ¼ cup pasta water, and toss together until the cheese emulsifies and the pasta is glossy with sauce. If needed, add another ¼ cup pasta water to loosen the sauce.

Serve in bowls and top with remaining bacon. Pass the grated Pecorino Romano at the table and season with flaky salt, if desired.

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place salmon on a plate, skin side up. Using a sharp knife, make a cut into the skin about ⅛-inch deep, in 3 different places, making sure not to cut all the way through the flesh. In a medium bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons olive oil with the Cajun seasoning, paprika and 1 teaspoon salt. Pour over the salmon to coat it on both sides and set aside to marinate while you prepare the rest of the dish.
Step 2
To a rimmed sheet pan, add potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Toss to coat and roast for about 15 minutes until tender. (Larger potatoes may take longer.)
Step 3
As potatoes roast, toss the asparagus with the garlic, the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.
Step 4
Move the potatoes to one end of the pan and place salmon skin side up next to them. Add asparagus in an even layer to the other end of the pan, and roast everything together for 10 to 13 minutes, until the asparagus is tender and the salmon is cooked to taste. If you’d like the skin to be crispy, you can transfer the vegetables from the pan to a serving platter and pop the fish under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot.
The thicker the asparagus, the better, as the steam from the fish can make thinner asparagus soggy.

Step 3
Place the noodles on a sheet pan. Add the sesame oil, 1 tablespoon neutral oil, soy sauce and ½ teaspoon kosher salt. Toss to combine, then evenly spread out the noodles.
Step 4
Dip each tofu slice into the marinade, coating both sides, then add them to the sheet pan, pushing the noodles aside so that the tofu touches the pan and doesn’t just sit on top of the noodles. Place on the bottom rack of the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reserve excess marinade.
Step 5
Place the baby bok choy into the reserved bowl, then add the remaining 1 tablespoon neutral oil and ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and toss to coat.
Step 6
Remove the sheet pan from the oven (the noodles should be crisp on the bottom and at the edges) and add the bok choy to the pan. Return the sheet pan to the top rack of the oven and bake for 4 to 7 minutes until the greens are vibrant with crispy edges, and the top of the noodles are crispy. Drizzle with the remaining marinade, top with cilantro leaves and serve.

"Crispy Sour Cream and Onion Chicken","Poultry,Chicken Breast,Chive,Panko,Sour Cream,Weekday,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","4
boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally (see Tip) and pounded ⅛-inch thick, or use 4 chicken cutlets (don’t split or pound)

Salt and black pepper
½
cup sour cream or Greek yogurt
¼
cup thinly sliced chives (or 1 tablespoon dried chives), plus more for serving
2
tablespoons onion powder
2
cups panko bread crumbs

Canola oil, for frying
1
lemon, cut into wedges","6379 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Pat chicken dry, and season both sides with salt and pepper.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, stir together the sour cream, chives and 1 tablespoon onion powder. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken and turn to coat. (Chicken can sit in the marinade for up to 8 hours. Refrigerate, then let come to room temperature before cooking.)
Step 3
In a shallow bowl or lipped plate, stir together the panko and remaining 1 tablespoon onion powder; season with salt and pepper.
Step 4
Working one at a time, press the chicken breasts into the panko, using your fingers to pack the panko onto both sides of the chicken, and place on a large plate or a sheet pan.
Step 5
Line a plate with paper towels. Heat ⅛-inch canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Drop a piece of panko in: If it sizzles, the oil’s ready. Add a chicken cutlet (or two, if they can fit comfortably), and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to the paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining chicken, adding and heating more oil as needed, and removing excess panko from the pan with a slotted spoon.
Step 6
Serve chicken with more chives and lemon wedges for squeezing.
Freezing the chicken breasts for 15 minutes to firm them up will make slicing them through the middle easier.

medium yellow onions (about 1 pound), peeled, halved and sliced

cup/170 grams unsalted butter

Fine sea salt and black pepper
1
large savoy cabbage (at least 2½ pounds)
1
teaspoon ground allspice

tablespoons pine nuts

packed cup finely chopped fresh parsley leaves
½
packed cup finely chopped fresh dill, plus 1 tablespoon to serve
3
tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)
1
heaping cup sour cream","314 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Place the onions, ½ cup butter and 1½ teaspoons of salt in a medium saucepan. Cook over medium heat for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned.
Step 2
While the onions cook, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Prepare the cabbage: Remove the very dark green outer leaves and save them for another use. Use a small knife to cut around the stem of the cabbage to release the base of the leaves; discard the core. Carefully peel off 12 leaves, taking care not to rip them. Set aside the remaining cabbage for later. Place the 12 leaves into the pot of boiling water and blanch for 2 minutes. Using tongs, remove the cabbage leaves and transfer to a large colander. Place in the sink under cold running water to cool down, then leave to strain.
Step 3
Once the onions are cooked, add the spices, walnuts and pine nuts and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly toasted. Place a heatproof sieve over a small saucepan and strain the mixture, reserving the spiced butter. Transfer the strained onion mixture to a medium bowl; combine with the parsley and dill, then set aside.
Step 4
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Finely slice about 4 cups of the remaining unblanched cabbage and place it in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. To fill the cabbage rolls, place the blanched leaves on a chopping board, stem side up. Use a peeler or a small sharp knife to shave the stem along its length so that it’s no longer raised and is level with the leaf. Divide the onion mixture into 12 portions (about 2 tablespoons each). With the stem side of a cabbage leaf facing you, place one portion of filling in the center of each leaf so it’s perpendicular to the stem. Bring the base and then the sides into the center, then roll the cabbage leaves all the way up to seal. Place each roll into the baking dish, seam side down, then pour over the lemon juice, dot with the remaining ¼ cup plain butter and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt.
Step 5
Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake the cabbage rolls for 1 hour. Remove the foil then return to the oven for about 20 minutes more, until nicely browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Step 6
While the cabbage is cooling, add the sour cream to a small saucepan and heat over medium for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, to loosen and warm through. Don’t let it bubble at all; you don’t want it to split. At the same time, gently reheat the spiced butter in its saucepan until melted. Next, pour the sour cream into the cabbage roll dish; avoid pouring it directly on top of the rolls. Shake the dish gently to mix the sour cream in, then pour the spiced butter over the cabbage rolls. Sprinkle with the extra dill, season with a good grind of black pepper and serve directly from the baking dish.

Heat a large (12-inch) sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-low, and add oil and onion; season lightly with salt and pepper. (The hot sauce added in Step 6 will add a lot of flavor, so be careful not to overseason here.) Let cook until the onions turn light beige in color and begin to caramelize, 20 to 25 minutes.
Step 2
Add garlic and cook until fragrant and starting to brown ever so slightly, about 2 minutes.
Step 3
Increase heat to medium-high and add bacon and ground beef, using the back of a large spoon to break up the meat into smaller pieces. Continue to cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated and the meat starts to sear and develop a crust on the bottom of the pan, 12 to 15 minutes.
Step 4
Remove pan from the heat and carefully drain off most of the fat, leaving a little in the pan to keep the meat moist.
Step 5
Return pan to medium-high heat and add white wine, allowing it to reduce until the mixture is almost dry, about 10 minutes.
Step 6
Add the chicken stock, heavy cream, hot sauce, paprika and bay leaf to the pan. Mix until combined and bring to a boil.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Step 2
Heat a large, high-sided skillet over medium-high. Add the oil and bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is crispy at the edges, about 5 minutes. Carefully drain all but 3 tablespoons of the fat, reserving any excess for later.
Step 3
Lower the heat to medium. Stir in the red-pepper flakes, oregano and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, just a few seconds. Add the onion, season generously with salt and pepper and cook over medium-high, stirring, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add more bacon fat if the pan dries out. Add the tomato paste and stir constantly until slightly darker in color, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the vodka.

Step 7
Divide the pasta among plates, sprinkling with any remaining pecorino and dolloping each serving with three spoonfuls of ricotta. Top with the parsley, which adds necessary freshness to counter the richness.

1
cup mint leaves, torn if large","231 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Position a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees. On a parchment-lined sheet pan, toss the torn pitas with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt.
Step 2
Finely grate the zest of 1 lime (about 1 teaspoon). In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the tahini, hot sauce, lime zest and cumin. At this point, you want it a tad too spicy, so add more hot sauce, if needed. Transfer ¼ cup of the spicy tahini to a large bowl, along with the ground chicken and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix with your hands to combine. Using oiled hands, form 12 meatballs (2 heaping tablespoons each) and place among the pita. (It’s OK if the pita is not in a single layer.) Roast on the bottom rack until the pita is well toasted and the chicken is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly.
Step 3
While the meatballs and pitas roast, wash and dry the large bowl. To it, add the cucumbers, avocados and a big pinch of salt. Add ¼ cup lime juice from the zested lime and another lime; stir to coat and set aside. Add water to the remaining spicy tahini until it’s pourable. Season to taste with salt. (See? Not too spicy anymore.)
Step 4
Cut the remaining lime into wedges. Add the pitas, mint and remaining ¼ cup olive oil to the cucumbers and avocado. Stir gently to combine and season to taste with salt and lime juice. Eat the salad with the meatballs, a drizzle of the tahini, lime wedges and even more hot sauce, if you like.
You can use any hot sauce or paste you like, from harissa to Tapatío, but avoid those with a lot of vinegar, like Frank’s or Tabasco, which could make the dish too sour on top of the lime.

In a heavy pot such as a Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium. Brown the diced pickled pork, about 5 minutes, then add the chopped onion. Cook, stirring occasionally and scraping the bottom of the pan, for 8 to 10 minutes until softened.
Step 3
Stir in the beans, ketchup, vinegar, thyme and hot sauce; season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover with fresh cold water, making sure there is enough water for the beans to cook thoroughly (at least 2 inches of water above the beans).
Step 4
Once the water has come to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until beans are semicooked, 45 to 60 minutes. Mash about 1 cup full of beans and return to the pot. Add the diced ham or ham bone and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until the beans are thoroughly cooked and the sauce is rich and creamy, 2 to 3 hours. (If at any point the beans seem dry, add water, 1 cup at a time, until creamy.)
Step 5
Serve with fluffy white rice and garnish with fried ham slices or fried country sausage. Also serve chopped onions, vinegar and hot sauce on the side and lots of hot French bread.

2
tablespoons minced chives or scallions","301 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 400 degrees. In a medium pot, combine potatoes with enough water to cover by 2 inches and several large pinches of salt. Boil until tender enough to easily pierce with a fork, 15 to 25 minutes. Drain.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons of the butter. Add shallots, thyme leaves and ½ teaspoon salt. Sauté until the shallots are very tender and deeply golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes (lower the heat if they start to burn).
Step 3
Add kale to the skillet, and cook until wilted and very tender, about 7 to 12 minutes. If the pan looks dry, add a splash of water. Taste and add more salt if needed.
Step 4
Add potatoes to the skillet and mash them with the kale to your preference — smooth or chunky — and add the milk, remaining 4 tablespoons butter and ½ cup cheese. Add remaining ½ teaspoon salt and black pepper. Taste and add more salt if needed.
Step 5
Using a spoon, smooth the potato mixture and create 4 large, shallow divots. Carefully crack an egg into each divot. Sprinkle each egg with salt. Top the eggs and potatoes with the remaining ½ cup cheese.
Step 6
Bake for 13 to 18 minutes, or until the whites are set and the egg yolks are cooked to taste. Top with chives and more pepper, and serve.

Using a sharp knife, trim the ends and peel off the brown skin from the jicama. Trim and peel the pineapple. Cut the jicama and pineapple lengthwise in half. Using a mandoline or a sharp chef’s knife, cut the jicama, pineapple and cucumbers into very thin slices (about 24 slices of jicama and 16 slices of pineapple). Using a sharp knife, remove the peel and pith from the oranges, then cut them into 8 slices each. Separate the leaves of the lettuce (you should have at least 20). Thinly slice the onion into rings and save the small ones from the center (save the remainder for another use). Thinly slice the serranos.

Sprinkle the chicken thighs with 1 teaspoon salt, then set aside. Meanwhile, in a wide pan or skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds.
Step 2
Add the chicken and then the sake. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink on the outside, about 5 minutes.

Pour in the dashi; it should just cover the ingredients. Stir in the tonkotsu sauce and karashi and bring the liquid to a boil. Bring the heat back down to maintain a lively simmer, then stir in the butter and cook until the sauce’s liquid is slightly thickened , 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 4
Meanwhile, butter one 2-quart broiler-safe casserole dish or several ramekins. Heat the broiler with the rack 6 inches from the heat source.
Step 5
Stir the spinach into the pan. Taste the mixture and season with salt and pepper accordingly. Add the cooked rice to the prepared casserole and spread in an even layer. Spoon the chicken mixture evenly on top of the rice, then top with the Parmesan, mozzarella and panko.

½
teaspoon sambal oelek or sriracha

Sliced scallions (optional), for serving","695 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.
Step 2
Wrap the drained tofu in a clean kitchen towel or in a few layers of paper towels. Place on a plate and weigh down tofu with something heavy, like a glass bowl, skillet or can, and allow to drain for at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes.
Step 3
While the tofu drains, in a large, wide bowl, combine the potato starch, salt and pepper. Unwrap the tofu and pat dry once more. Cut the tofu into ¾-inch cubes and add to the potato starch mixture. Use your fingers to gently toss until coated.
Step 4
Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place the tofu in the air fryer basket, shaking off any excess potato starch while transferring. Once the tofu is in the air fryer basket, spray once more with the cooking spray to prevent clumping. Cook until tofu becomes slightly puffed, about 10 minutes. Use tongs to move tofu pieces around the basket. Continue to cook until lightly browned in some spots and crisped all around, about 10 minutes.
Step 5
Discard the potato starch from the large bowl, wipe it clean and set it aside. While the tofu cooks, make the sauce: In a small skillet, combine the brown sugar, vinegar and soy sauce over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly and clings lightly to the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the sambal.
Step 6
Return the crispy tofu to a large bowl. Pour the soy glaze over the tofu; toss to coat. Transfer to a serving plate and top with scallions, if using.

Place the bread on a sheet pan, drizzle with olive oil on both sides and toast under the broiler (flipping halfway through) until crisp and golden brown yet still slightly soft in the middle, about 5 minutes. Set aside. (Alternatively, you can toast the oiled bread in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.)
Step 2
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large (at least 12-inch) skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until bacon is golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. Turn off heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Leave 4 tablespoons of fat in the pan and discard or save the rest.
Step 3
Turn the heat back on to medium-high, add the brussels sprouts, season with salt and pepper and arrange the brussels sprouts cut sides down.

1
tablespoon finely chopped flat leaf parsley
1½
teaspoons white wine vinegar

Pinch fine sea salt

Pinch granulated sugar","135 user ratings","1 hour 35 minutes","Step 1
Add the olive oil to a large pot over a medium-low heat. Add the onions, cover the pan, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, about 7 minutes.
Step 2
Add the beans, tomatoes, garlic, parsley, paprika, ginger, turmeric and salt. Pour in the vegetable stock, cover with a lid and cook until the beans are fully cooked and soft, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 25 minutes. Keep an eye on the pot towards the end of the cooking process to make sure that the beans don’t dry out and all the stock evaporates (if this happens, add in water progressively to achieve a stew consistency).
Step 3
To make the optional parsley oil, stir together the olive oil, parsley, white wine vinegar, salt and sugar in a small bowl. Cover and keep in the refrigerator until ready to serve, up to 48 hours.
Step 4
Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning with salt if necessary. Serve immediately with a drizzle of parsley oil or olive oil, if desired, and bread on the side.
For a quicker version, use three (16-ounce) cans of cannellini beans instead of dried. Follow the recipe steps as instructed without adding the cannellini beans at the beginning of the cooking process, and use 2 cups of stock instead of 2½. Cook for 45 minutes, then add the rinsed and drained beans. Cook for another 20 minutes and serve.

Juice of ½ lemon (about 2 tablespoons)
½
cup (about 1¾ ounces) grated pecorino, plus more for serving","327 user ratings","7 hours and 15 minutes","Step 1
Stir together the beans, broth, olive oil, garlic and 1 teaspoon of the pepper in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on low until the beans are tender, about 7 hours.
Step 2
Put the pancetta in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the pork has rendered most of its fat and is deep golden brown and crunchy in spots, about 10 minutes. (You may need to lower the heat to medium-low and/or add a spoonful of water to keep the pork from scorching as the fat renders.)
Step 3
Add the pork and its fat, the lemon juice and the pecorino into the beans in the slow cooker. Stir vigorously until the pecorino has completely melted and the sauce has become smooth and emulsified, lightly coating the back of a spoon. Taste and add more pepper if you like. Pass more pecorino and pepper at the table.
Beans should reach a simmer and cook until tender to be safe to eat. If your slow cooker does not reach a simmer on the low setting, increase the heat level to high, and ensure the beans cook at a simmer for at least 15 minutes at some point in the cooking process.

1
large basil leaf, finely chopped
¼
small garlic clove, finely grated (optional)

Fresh lemon juice, to taste

Red-pepper flakes, to taste","392 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
Fill a pot with water and salt heavily. Bring to a boil over high heat and add the pasta.
Step 2
While the pasta is cooking, add the tomato sauce, bottarga, colatura, basil, garlic (if using), a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of red-pepper flakes to a large bowl. No need to stir.
Step 3
When the pasta is al dente, reserve ¼ cup pasta cooking water then drain the pasta. Add the hot pasta to the bowl with bottarga and mix well, tossing to coat. The bottarga will start to melt and create a creamy sauce, glossing and clinging to the strands. If the pasta seems very dry, add a little of the pasta water. Season to taste with additional lemon juice and red-pepper flakes, if desired. Serve immediately.
Jarred yellow cherry tomato sauce, bottarga di muggine (cured grey mullet roe) and colatura di alici may be purchased online and from Italian or gourmet groceries.
If you do not have colatura on hand, you may substitute ½ to 1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce. Because Asian fish sauce is stronger in flavor than colatura, be sure to taste and adjust as you go.
If you cannot find jarred yellow cherry tomato sauce, you may also take fresh yellow cherry tomatoes, dip them into boiling water with a slotted spoon for a few seconds, then plunge them into a bowl of ice water. Slip off the skins, crush the tomatoes lightly and remove the seeds. Note that yellow tomatoes have less acidity, so red tomatoes and red tomato sauce cannot be substituted.

large egg, beaten","47 user ratings","1½ hours, plus 2½ hours proofing and cooling","Step 1
Combine the flour and yeast in a large bowl or a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the warmed milk, then mix on low speed just until incorporated.
Step 2
In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and yolks with the sugar and vanilla until foamy, then whisk in the sour cream and orange zest. Add to the flour with the mixer running on low speed to incorporate, then beat on medium speed for 5 to 8 minutes, until thick strands of dough begin to separate. Start adding the butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, incorporating well after each addition. At this stage, you can change to a dough hook or knead by hand until the dough is smooth and coming away from the sides of the bowl. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rest for 1½ hours in a warm place.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the filling by blitzing the walnuts and sultanas together in a food processor. Add the milk and the orange blossom water and mix well. In a separate bowl, beat the reserved egg whites with the sugar to stiff peaks, then combine with the walnut mixture. Set aside.
Step 4
Grease and line two 4-by-8¼-inch loaf pans.
Step 5
Turn the dough onto a lightly oiled work surface, shape it into a log and divide it into 4 equal parts. Gently stretch and roll one part until it’s the length of the pan and double its width. Spread with a quarter of the filling mixture and roll it up into a log. Repeat with the second piece of dough, then twist them together, tucking the ends in, if necessary, and place in the pan. Repeat with the other pieces of dough and place in the second pan. Cover and leave to proof for 30 minutes in a warm place.

Naan plus yogurt seasoned with toasted cumin and salt, for serving (all optional)","36 user ratings","About 6 hours, plus cooling and chilling","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
Step 2
In a large, deep roasting pan, drizzle the oxtail with 1 tablespoon ghee, then sprinkle with the garlic, plus 1 tablespoon salt and 1 tablespoon black pepper. Massage the meat until evenly coated and then spread it out in an even layer. Roast for 45 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 250 degrees.
Step 3
While the oxtail roasts, prepare the onion purée: In a small Dutch oven or pot, heat 2 tablespoons ghee over medium-high. Add the onion slices and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to show a light brown color, about 8 minutes. Lower the heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until dark golden brown, soft and considerably reduced in volume, about 30 minutes. (If they appear to stick to the bottom of the pan, add a few tablespoons of water as needed to deglaze the pan.) Set the onion aside to cool for a few minutes, then pulse in a blender until smooth, stirring as needed. Set purée aside. (You should have about ½ cup.)
Step 4
Prepare the ginger purée: Coarsely chop the 3 ounces ginger into ½-inch pieces. (If any of the skin appears tough, slice it off and discard it, but otherwise leave the peel on.) Pour 3 tablespoons water into the blender, then add the chopped ginger. Blend in short intervals, turning the mixture around with a spatula to get all of it, until puréed. (You should have about ⅓ cup.)

Wipe out the Dutch oven, then heat the remaining ¼ cup ghee over high heat. Add the cloves, cardamom seeds and chickpea flour and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the mixture darkens and bubbles and a fragrant, nutty aroma emits. Quickly stir in the onion purée, ginger purée, red chile powder, cumin, turmeric and 1 teaspoon salt, then gradually stir in 5 cups water and bring to a boil.
Step 6
After the oxtail has been roasted, pour the mixture over it, seal it tightly with foil and place it back in the oven for 4 to 6 hours. The meat should be falling off the bone.

3 to 4
limes, quartered, for garnish","190 user ratings","2¼ hours","Step 1
In a large heavy-bottomed casserole or pot, place the meat, onion half, mint, garlic, bay leaves and about 1 tablespoon salt. Cover with 8 cups of water and bring to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Skim off any foam that rises to the surface, then reduce the heat to low or medium-low; cover and simmer for 1 hour.
Step 2
While the mixture simmers, place the ancho and pasilla chiles in a medium bowl, cover with boiling water and let them rehydrate for 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 3
Place the tomatoes and tomatillo in a baking dish under the broiler and cook until they are completely charred and mushy, 10 to 20 minutes.
Step 4
In a small skillet set over medium heat, toast the sesame seeds, stirring constantly, anywhere from 1 to 2 minutes, until they start to become golden brown.
Step 5
In a blender, place the soaked chiles and ¼ cup of their soaking liquid, plus the broiled tomatoes and tomatillos, and the toasted sesame seeds; purée until completely smooth.
Step 6
Remove the cooked onion, mint and garlic cloves from the large casserole or pot (if some remain, it is totally fine). Pour the chile mixture in with the meat. Stir, cover again and cook for another 30 minutes.
Step 7
Remove the lid, raise heat to medium, add the cubed chayote squash and the corn and cook, partially covered, for 15 minutes. Add the zucchini and green beans and cook, partially covered, for another 10 minutes; season to taste with salt.
Step 8
Serve in bowls, making sure that each bowl has a serving of meat, corn, chayote, green beans and zucchini. Serve with the finely chopped white onion, cilantro and quartered limes to dress at the table.
Traditionally, this recipe uses xoconostles, which can be hard to find. Instead, tomatillos have a similar tart flavor.

½
cup finely chopped parsley
2
tablespoons thinly sliced chives
1
tablespoon tarragon leaves
1
tablespoon dill
1
teaspoon grated lemon zest","312 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Lay the chicken thighs in one layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Season generously on both sides with salt and pepper. With fingers, a fine-mesh sieve or sifter, dust the thighs very lightly with flour, then shake off any excess.
Step 2
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a deep, wide skillet or, preferably, a Dutch oven over medium. When oil is wavy, add 3 or 4 thighs to the pan, making sure not to crowd them. Cook thighs gently for about 5 to 8 minutes, turning with tongs about halfway through, just until faintly browned, then transfer to a clean plate. Repeat with remaining thighs. Set thighs aside and wipe out the pan.
Step 3
Add 2 tablespoons butter to the pan. When it sizzles, add onion, and season with salt and pepper, stirring to coat. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until completely softened but not browned, about 8 to 10 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary.
Step 4
Raise heat to medium-high. Add wine, tomato paste, bay leaf, nutmeg and cayenne. Stir to combine and continue cooking until wine has evaporated, about 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons flour over the mixture and stir well. When the mixture begins to dry out, add 2 cups broth, whisking rapidly as the mixture begins to thicken. When it begins to simmer, whisk in 2 more cups, then repeat with the final 2 cups.
Step 5
Add the thighs and any accumulated juices to the pot and bring everything to a gentle simmer. Cover, leaving lid ajar. Cook until thighs are tender when probed with a fork, about 40 minutes. Remove chicken. Reduce broth over medium-high heat to a gravylike consistency, stirring occasionally, about 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 6
Skim any rising surface fat. Taste and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat.
Step 7
Meanwhile, prepare the vegetables: Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add carrots and simmer for 6 to 9 minutes, until tender. Remove and set aside. Now cook the turnips for about 5 minutes, until tender, then remove and add to carrots. Drain the pot, wipe out and set aside vegetables.
Step 8
When ready to serve the vegetables, in the same pot, melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and leek, and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes without browning. Add peas, limas, artichokes, carrots and turnips. Season vegetables with salt and pepper, and stir gently to combine. Add 1 cup water and put on the lid. They should all be heated through in 5 to 6 minutes.
Step 9
To serve the chicken, return thighs to sauce and bring to a simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the crème fraîche. Prepare the herb topping: Mix herbs and lemon zest in a small bowl.
Step 10
Transfer chicken and sauce to a serving bowl or individual shallow bowls. Sprinkle with herb mixture. Garnish with some of the vegetables; pass the rest in a separate dish, leaving the liquid behind.

Season the beef with salt; set aside at room temperature for at least 20 minutes.
Step 2
In a large stew pot, heat the oil over medium until it shimmers. Add the peppercorns, chile and bay leaves and cook, stirring, until they are fragrant and little bubbles form around the spices, about 1 minute. Add the onion, garlic and ginger and cook until the onion is translucent, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes.
Step 3
Add the seasoned short ribs, plus 5 cups water and a pinch of salt (don’t add too much here). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover and simmer until the meat is tender when pierced with a fork, 2½ to 3 hours.

Heat oven to 300 degrees.
Step 2
In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Pat meat dry and brown on both sides, leaving it untouched until a crust forms on the bottom. Adjust the heat so that the meat sizzles enthusiastically but does not pop or scorch. When browned, remove it to a large plate.
Step 3
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pot. Add onions, sprinkle with salt and cook over medium heat, scraping the bottom of the pan. Adjust the heat and stir often, so the onions soften but do not brown, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the mixture forms a soft, pale brown mass, 5 minutes more.
Step 4
Raise heat to medium-high, add paprika and cook, stirring, until the mixture sizzles. Push onions aside and add tomato paste to the center of the pot. Cook, stirring frequently, until it’s sizzling, then stir it into the onion mixture.
Step 5
Return meat and its juices to the pot. Add carrots, thyme and enough hot water to cover the carrots and onions (do not cover the meat). Cover tightly and bake until completely fork-tender, about 3 hours, turning the meat halfway through cooking.
Step 6
Remove pot from the oven. Remove the meat and carrots from the pot and set aside; discard the bay leaf, if using. Using a hand blender, purée the contents of the pot into a smooth gravy (or strain, then push the vegetables through a sieve and combine with the liquid). Heat the gravy through and, if necessary, simmer until thickened. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper.
Step 7
If using a single piece of meat, slice the meat across the grain into ¼-inch-thick slices. Return meat and carrots to the pot, nestling them into the gravy. Cover and heat through over very low heat. Serve immediately, or, for the best flavor, refrigerate overnight and reheat before serving.

In a large Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium. Add the tomato paste, garlic, coriander, ½ teaspoon Italian seasoning and the red-pepper flakes. Stir until the tomato paste is a shade darker and sticking to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 4 minutes. (Try not to rush this step; it’s where the flavor of the soup develops.)
Step 2
Add 4 ½ cups of water, the lentils and 1 teaspoon salt. Increase heat to medium-high, scrape any browned bits stuck to the pot and stir to break up the big chunks of tomato paste. Partially cover the pot and bring to a simmer, then completely cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the lentils start to break down and lose their shape, 15 to 20 minutes.

3
scallions, thinly sliced
1
teaspoon ground white pepper

Chopped and whole cilantro leaves and lime wedges, for serving","182 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
If using fresh pineapple, slice the pineapple and stem in half lengthwise. (If you’re using canned pineapple, skip this whole step.) Use a paring knife to cut around the perimeter of the pineapple meat to form a bowl shape, leaving a ½-inch rim, then slice into the pineapple crosswise (taking care not to go through the skin on the bottom). To form the bowl, use a spoon to scoop out the slices, carefully carving out any remaining bits left behind and discarding the hard core. Cut the pineapple meat into ½-inch pieces. Measure out 1 cup and set aside. Save the leftover pineapple half for a late-night snack, or hollow it out, as well, reserving the meat for another time.
Step 2
In a dry wok or large skillet over medium heat, toast the cashews, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove the cashews and set aside.
Step 3
Increase the heat to medium-high, add the bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes to render the bacon fat and crisp the bacon. Add the butter and let it melt, then stir in the garlic until fragrant, just a few seconds.
Step 4
Add the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is seared on the outside, about 3 minutes. Add the onion and stir until softened, about 2 minutes.
Step 5
Stir in the curry powder, sugar and chile powder, then the peas and fish sauce, tossing to distribute the curry powder. Then, immediately add the rice, reserved pineapple, raisins and red chiles. Cook for about 2 minutes, stirring and tossing often until any liquid has evaporated and the rice starts to brown.
Step 6
To finish, add the scallions, toasted cashews, white pepper and as much chopped cilantro as you’d like, tossing to combine. Taste and season with more fish sauce, if needed. Transfer some of the mixture to the pineapple bowl (if using), and transfer the rest to a serving platter. Garnish with whole cilantro leaves and serve with lime wedges.
Red-pepper flakes work in a pinch, as do gochugaru and Aleppo, but for the full experience, buy a chile powder made from Thai red chiles. You also can spread whole dried peppers, such as Thai, de árbol or Japones, across a large sheet pan and toast in a 350-degree oven for about 6 minutes, then grind them in a dry blender or spice grinder.

1
cup dry red wine
2
(28-ounce) cans crushed tomatoes","192 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Place a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil and the pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pancetta is crisp and the fat has rendered, about 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a medium bowl.
Step 2
To the bowl, add the bread crumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, 2 tablespoons parsley, 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt; set aside.
Step 3
Pound the steaks thinly until they are about 8 inches long and 4 inches wide. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Cut each steak in half to create 4-by-4-inch pieces.
Step 4
Working with one piece of steak at a time, sprinkle 1 rounded tablespoon of the bread crumb mixture evenly over each steak. Roll the steak up, then thread a toothpick along each seam to retain the filling.
Step 5
Reheat the oil in the Dutch oven over medium heat and add another tablespoon of olive oil. Working in two batches, add the steak rolls, seam side down, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the seam is sealed and the steak begins to brown. Flip and brown the other side for another 3 to 4 minutes and place on a dish to reserve until all the rolls are seared.
Step 6
Deglaze the pot by adding the wine and stirring and scraping to release any browned bits then simmer, stirring frequently, until the wine has reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes, swishing out each can with about 1 cup of water and adding to the pot. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of parsley and bring to a low boil over medium heat.
Step 7
Add the steak rolls to the Dutch oven and reduce the sauce to a simmer. Partially cover the pot and simmer, until the meat is very tender and the toothpicks release easily, about 1½ hours. Discard the toothpicks.

small garlic clove, finely grated or minced
½
teaspoon finely grated fresh ginger
1
tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1
tablespoon honey, plus more to taste
½
cup smooth peanut butter, preferably natural","893 user ratings","45 minutes, plus at least 1 hour’s marinating","Step 1
Prepare the chicken: In a small bowl, mix together sesame oil, salt, ginger and garlic, and smear mixture all over the chicken and underneath the skin. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet (or plate), preferably on a rack to allow air to circulate, and refrigerate uncovered for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.
Step 2
Heat oven to 425 degrees. Remove the rack under the chicken if you’ve used one. If the chicken isn’t on a rimmed baking sheet, transfer it to one (you can line it with parchment to make clean-up easier, but it’s not necessary). Pat the legs dry with a paper towel. Drizzle chicken with the neutral oil. Roast until the chicken is golden brown and the juices run clear when the thickest part of the thigh is pricked with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.
Step 3
While chicken is in the oven, make the peanut sauce: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and ginger until combined, then whisk in sesame oil and honey. Add peanut butter and whisk until smooth. If the mixture is very thick (and this depends on your brand of peanut butter), whisk in a few tablespoons of cold water until it becomes a thick but pourable sauce.
Step 4
Transfer chicken to a serving plate and carefully pour any pan juices on the baking sheet into the bowl with the peanut sauce. Whisk until combined. Taste the sauce and add more soy sauce, vinegar or honey if you’d like.
Step 5
Drizzle or brush some of the peanut sauce all over chicken pieces, reserving some sauce for serving. Garnish with scallions and serve with reserved peanut sauce.

"Microwave Rice","Grains And Rice,Basmati Rice,Jasmine Rice,Breakfast,Dinner,Easy,Lunch,Quick,Weeknight,Side Dish","Yield: About 3 cups cooked rice (about 4 servings)","1
cup long-grain white rice (such as basmati or jasmine; see Tip)","681 user ratings","20 to 30 minutes","Step 1
Rinse the rice: Add the rice to a sieve and run water over it while swishing it around with your hands. Do this until the water below the sieve looks clear, a few minutes. Drain well. Alternatively, place the rice into a large bowl, add water to cover it, swish the rice around a few times with your hands and drain it out. Do this 3 to 4 times, until the water you drain runs clear. If the rice isn't thoroughly rinsed, it may clump.
Step 2
Transfer the rinsed rice to a large (2½- to 3-quart) microwave-safe bowl and add 2 cups of room-temperature water. Microwave, uncovered, on full power for 15 to 25 minutes. If you have a powerful microwave (1000 to 1200 watts), start with 15 minutes. If you have a less powerful microwave (700 to 900 watts), start at around 20 minutes. The rice will be done when the grains are poking up like grass and are tender and the water is fully absorbed; the grains shouldn’t look wet or mushy. If the rice isn’t done, keep microwaving it in 1- to 2-minute increments. After the rice is cooked, let it rest, undisturbed, in the closed microwave for another 5 minutes, then fluff it with a fork or rice paddle. (Some condensation may collect in the interior of the microwave but can be easily wiped dry.)
You also can use this technique for brown rice. Follow the instructions above, using 2½ cups water for 1 cup long-grain brown rice and cook for 20 to 30 minutes.

tablespoon coriander seeds
1
teaspoon cumin seeds
3
small shallots (each the size of a walnut), coarsely chopped
8 to 10
fresh red Thai chiles, stems removed (see Tip)
1
stalk lemongrass (use the lower 3 inches at the base), coarsely chopped
3
pieces fresh galangal (each the size of a quarter), see Tip
2
medium fresh makrut lime leaves, middle ribs stripped and discarded (see Tip)
1
tablespoon shrimp paste or brown soybean paste (see Tip)","61 user ratings","10 minutes","Step 1
Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is at the right temperature (usually takes 2 to 3 minutes), sprinkle in the coriander and cumin. Shake the skillet or use a spoon to stir the seeds around frequently until they are an even reddish-brown color with a scintillating aroma, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the seeds to a small bowl or plate to cool. Once cool to the touch, transfer them to a spice grinder (or clean coffee grinder) and pulverize them until they have the texture of finely ground black pepper.
Step 2
Pile the shallots, chiles, lemongrass, galangal and lime leaves into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the ingredients to a coarse paste. Transfer the mixture to a mortar and pound it into a smoother paste with a pestle, using a spatula to contain it in the mortar’s cavernous center for a more concentrated beating. If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, continue to grind the paste to a finer texture in the food processor.
Step 3
Transfer this to a small bowl and stir in the shrimp paste and the ground spices. For all this mellow work, you will be gifted a reddish-brown paste redolent of chiles and fruity aromas. Store it in a lidded glass jar in the refrigerator for up to a week or freeze it for up to three months.
If you can’t find fresh Thai chiles, reconstitute dried red chiles (like chiles de árbol or bird’s-eye chiles) under boiling hot water for 30 minutes.
Fresh galangal, makrut lime leaves and shrimp paste can be found in Southeast Asian markets, as can brown soybean paste (such as doenjang), which is made with salted and fermented soybeans.

"Winter Squash and Rice Soup with Pancetta","Bacon,Butternut Squash,Jasmine Rice,Pancetta,Soup,Dinner,Weeknight,Main Course","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","1
small butternut squash (1½ to 2 pounds) or 1 medium delicata squash (about 2 pounds), peeled (see Tip), halved, seeded and cut into ¾-inch chunks
3
tablespoons granulated sugar
4
tablespoons olive oil

Salt and pepper
8
ounces pancetta or bacon, diced
1
large onion, chopped
4
garlic cloves, finely chopped
5
fresh thyme sprigs
¾
cup jasmine rice (or other long-grain rice), rinsed
8
cups chicken broth (preferably homemade)

Chopped fresh parsley, for serving","374 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment. Toss the squash on the prepared sheet pan with the sugar and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt and pepper and roast, tossing once halfway through, until cooked through but not too soft, with golden-brown bits of caramelization on the edges, about 30 minutes. Turn off the oven, set aside.
Step 2
Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium-high heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden-brown and crisp, about 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and discard all but 2 tablespoons of fat.
Step 3
Add onion and garlic to the pot, season with salt and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and lightly browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Add thyme sprigs and keep stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add rice and stir to coat in the fat.
Step 4
Add the broth and bring to a boil then lower heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until rice is slightly al dente, 20 to 25 minutes total. (If you want the rice a little more done, no need to fret; as the rice sits in the hot broth, it will continue to cook.) Discard thyme sprigs and taste and season with salt, if necessary.
Step 5
This soup is best enjoyed immediately, to make sure all the textures and flavors stay bold and varied, so wait to add the squash, pancetta and garnishes until you're about to sit down to a bowl. When ready to eat, ladle the brothy rice into bowls; top with the squash, pancetta, fresh parsley and more black pepper, if desired.
If using delicata squash, there is no need to peel.

3
tablespoons/42 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, plus softened butter for the pan

tablespoons/30 grams cold cream cheese

tablespoons/28 grams unsalted butter, very soft
For the Glaze (optional)
¼
cup/60 grams cream cheese, room temperature
3
tablespoons confectioners’ sugar, or to taste
1
orange","639 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Make the dough: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the brown sugar in a small bowl and zest the orange directly over it. Gently rub the zest into the sugar and transfer 2 tablespoons/25 grams to a large bowl to use for the dough. Save the rest of the orange sugar for the filling.
Step 2
Add the flour, baking powder and salt to the large bowl and whisk well. Add the butter and cream cheese, and smash and rub them into the dry ingredients with your fingertips until they’re fully incorporated and the mixture resembles crumbs.
Step 3
Add the milk all at once and stir gently with a fork until the dough comes together and no dry bits remain. Freeze while you prepare the pan and filling. Very generously butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch round cake pan or ovenproof skillet.
Step 4
Make the filling: Mix the cinnamon (and cardamom, if using) into the reserved orange sugar.
Step 5
Scrape the dough onto a well-floured work surface. Use a floured rolling pin to roll the dough or flour your hands to pat the dough into a 12-by-5-inch rectangle. It may be sticky, but that’s OK. Just flour the dough enough to be able to shape it.
Step 6
To fill the dough, spread the very soft butter evenly over the surface, then sprinkle the orange sugar on top. Starting with one long side of the dough, roll it up into a 12-inch-long log. If it’s stuck to the surface, scrape it up as you roll it using a bench scraper or stiff spatula.
Step 7
Use a serrated knife to cut the log with a sawing motion into 8 (1½-inch-thick) slices. Place a slice in the center of the pan, then space the remaining slices ½-inch apart around it. At this point, the rolls can be covered and chilled for up to 2 days before baking directly from the refrigerator.
Step 8
Bake until golden on top, 23 to 25 minutes. You don’t want to overbake, but also want the dough to be cooked through. When you press the top, the roll shouldn’t sink but spring back just a little.
Step 9
If you’d like to glaze the rolls, make the glaze while the rolls bake: Place the cream cheese then the confectioners’ sugar in a bowl. Zest the orange directly over the sugar, then mix and smush together until smooth. Squeeze in 2 tablespoons orange juice and mix well. The glaze should be a bit thick because it will loosen when it hits the hot rolls. Taste and add more confectioners’ sugar if you’d like. Stir in more juice if it’s too stiff.
Step 10
Let the rolls cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then spread the glaze all over them. Cool a bit longer to serve hot or warm.

To press the tofu, drain it and place it on a cutting board or plate between paper towels. Press down firmly with your hand to get rid of the excess moisture. Pat the tofu dry then cut it into 1-inch cubes.
Step 2
Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil appears to shimmer, add the tofu cubes and stir-fry them until they turn light brown along the sides. Transfer them onto a plate.
Step 3
To the same oil, carefully add the curry paste. Stir-fry the potent melange, as the chiles elevate their heat and send you into a throat-clearing moment, 1 to 2 minutes. Yes, adequate venting or opening a window is advised.
Step 4
Add the eggplant, potato, bell pepper and bamboo shoots to the curry paste. Shake the coconut milk well, pour it over the vegetables and scrape the bottom of the pot, deglazing it.
Step 5
Add the tofu and fish sauce and bring the curry to a boil. Cover the pan, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes and eggplant are fork-tender, 10 to 12 minutes. During the last few minutes of cooking, remove the lid and continue to simmer, uncovered, to allow the sauce to thicken a bit.
Step 6
Serve sprinkled with the basil alongside a bowl of jasmine rice.
Baby green eggplants can be found in Southeast Asian supermarkets or farmers’ markets. If you cannot find them, you can use about 6 ounces of any variety, cut into bite-size pieces.
Thai basil, which is peppery with an anise-like flavor, adds an extra layer of refinement to this curry, but sweet basil can be used instead.

Steamed grains, such as rice or fonio, for serving
1
lime, sliced into wedges, for serving","327 user ratings","35 minutes, plus marinating","Step 1
Season both sides of the fish lightly with salt and black pepper. In a large bowl, combine the tamarind purée, molasses, ginger, garlic, coconut cream, 1 tablespoon olive oil, ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Thinly slice 2 scallions and add to the marinade. Cut the remaining scallions into 1-inch pieces and set aside. Add the fish to the marinade and turn to coat. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes and up to 12 hours.
Step 2
Heat the oven to 450 degrees. In a large (12-inch) oven-safe skillet, combine the broccolini and chopped scallions. Toss with 1 tablespoon oil and season lightly with salt and black pepper. Spread in an even layer, then place the fish right on top of the vegetables and pour any leftover marinade over the fish.
Step 3
Roast until the fish is opaque but the center is not cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness of the fish. The fish should not flake easily with a fork. Remove the pan from the oven and heat the broiler to high. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon of oil over the fish.
Step 4
Move the pan to the broiler and finish cooking, rotating the pan once, until the fish is tender and flakes easily and the broccolini is just tender and beginning to brown in spots, 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the broiler and sprinkle the fish with chopped cilantro.
Step 5
Serve the fish and broccolini over steamed grains, such as rice or fonio. Tip the pan juices over the fish and serve with lime wedges for squeezing.
Tamarind can be purchased as a purée or paste and varies in degrees of concentration. Taste store-bought tamarind before use to determine how acidic it is and how much to use in the marinade. Tamarind pods or pulp can also be purchased to make the purée at home. Follow this recipe to make your own. All options are available online or at African, Carribean or Asian grocery stores.

1
cup green lentils
1
medium bunch chard (8 to 10 ounces)
¼
cup lemon or lime juice (from 2 lemons or limes)","1030 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
In a large Dutch oven or pot, combine the oil, scallions, garlic, cumin, bay leaf (if using), a pinch of salt and one jalapeño half. Set over medium heat and cook, stirring constantly, until scallions are softened and fragrant but not browned, 2 to 4 minutes.
Step 2
Add 5 cups of water, the sweet potato, lentils and 1½ teaspoons salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 10 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, thinly slice the chard stems all the way to the leaves. Place the stems in a small bowl; add the lemon juice and season with salt. Thinly slice the remaining jalapeño and add to the chard stems to taste. (If you don’t want your soup too spicy, just add a few slices, or leave them out entirely.) Coarsely chop the chard leaves.
Step 4
After the lentils have been simmering for 10 minutes, taste the broth. If flavors are muted, add more salt. If the broth tastes spicy to you at this stage, remove the jalapeño. Add the chard leaves, stir to combine, then cover and cook until the lentils and sweet potato are tender, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat and thin with water if necessary. Remove and discard the bay leaf plus the jalapeño half (if you haven’t already done so).
Step 5
Divide soup among bowls. Top bowls with a spoonful of the chard stems, jalapeño and lemon juice. For a more bracing soup, add another spoonful or two. Soup and topping will keep separately for up to 3 days in the refrigerator. Warm the soup, add water and salt as needed, then combine with the citrusy chard stems.

Prepare the marinated tofu: Combine the tamari or soy sauce, shaoxing rice wine and salt in a bowl. Add the tofu cubes and toss to coat. Allow to marinate at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the spice mix: Combine cumin, gochugaru, sugar and salt in a small bowl and set aside.
Step 3
Drain the tofu. Place the potato starch or cornstarch in an even layer on a plate, add the marinated tofu cubes and turn gently to coat.
Step 4
Heat a large frying pan over high for 3 minutes. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil and add a tofu cube. If the oil sizzles, it’s hot enough. Add all the tofu cubes, being careful of spattering, arranging them in one layer and separating them from one another. Reduce the heat to medium and allow the tofu to cook, undisturbed, for 1 to 2 minutes, until the bottom is golden. Flip the tofu and cook until golden on all sides. Transfer the tofu to a plate lined with paper towels. Wipe out the pan.

1
pound green cabbage, cored and cut into 1-inch pieces, leaves separated
2
garlic cloves, coarsely chopped

Spicy brown or Dijon mustard, for serving","97 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
In a small bowl, stir together the paprika, brown sugar, coriander, onion powder and 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Rub the spice mixture into all sides of the steaks. Coat one side of the steaks with half the mayonnaise and place the steaks in a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, mayonnaise sides down. Paint the tops with the remaining mayonnaise.
Step 2
Set the skillet over high heat and cook for 2 minutes per side. Reduce the heat to medium and cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until a thermometer inserted in the center registers 120 to 125 degrees for medium-rare, a further 8 to 12 minutes. Adjust the heat as needed so the steaks are sizzling but not smoking. To prevent spices from falling off, grab the steaks by the edges instead of tops and bottoms. If steak has a fat cap, hold upright to sear the fat cap until crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate to rest while you cook the cabbage.
Step 3
Wipe out the skillet, then add the oil and heat over medium. Add the cabbage and spread into an even layer. Cook undisturbed until charred underneath, 3 to 4 minutes, then toss occasionally until charred in spots and crisp-tender, another 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic and any steak resting juices and stir until fragrant, 1 minute. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium. Add shallot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3 minutes.

1½
tablespoons packed light brown sugar
5½
ounces prunes (about 1 cup)
⅓
cup chopped parsley","395 user ratings","2¾ hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Season the pork all over with the salt and several generous grinds of black pepper. Melt the butter with the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Add half the pork chunks, spread them out, and let them brown on one side without moving them for 5 minutes. (If the pan starts to burn, reduce the heat to medium-high.) Remove the pork to a plate and repeat with the remaining pork. (You can sear the pork on more than one side, but doing it on one side saves time and is enough to build flavor and texture.)
Step 2
Reduce the heat to medium and add the shallots. Cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and cook, stirring, to evenly combine, about 1 minute. Add ¼ cup of the sherry vinegar and the red wine; bring to a simmer, scraping up any bits at the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken broth, thyme and orange zest strips. Season with a generous pinch of salt. Stir in the pork and any juices on the plate. Bring to a boil, then cover the pot and braise in the oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile stir together the remaining ¼ cup sherry vinegar, the brown sugar and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the prunes and set aside.
Step 4
Uncover the pork and add the prunes and their soaking liquid. Let the dish cook another 40 to 50 minutes, until the pork is very tender and the sauce is reduced and thickened. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs, then stir in the parsley. Serve topped with chopped orange segments, if desired.

Put the butter in a microwave-safe bowl or large liquid measuring cup and melt it in the microwave, about 1 minute. Stir in the flour until the mixture looks like cake batter and microwave 15 to 30 seconds, just to warm the flour. Scrape the mixture out into a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker.
Step 2
Whisk ¼ cup of the sherry vinegar and the red wine into the roux in the slow cooker. Stir in the pork, shallots, orange zest, thyme, salt and several generous grinds of black pepper. Cover the slow cooker and set to cook on high for 4 hours.
Step 3
Meanwhile, stir together the remaining ¼ cup sherry vinegar, the brown sugar and a pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the prunes and set aside.
Step 4
About an hour before the pork is done, using a slotted spoon, add the soaked prunes to the slow cooker, along with about 1½ tablespoons of the soaking liquid. (Discard the remaining liquid or save it for a salad dressing.) Continue to cook until the pork is tender and the flavors are blended. If you would like to reduce the sauce, you can keep the slow cooker on high, remove the lid, and let it bubble for 10 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard the thyme sprigs. Stir in the parsley and serve with chopped orange segments, if desired.
For extra depth and texture, sear the pork first: Working in batches, sear the meat in a large skillet in two tablespoons of vegetable oil, without disturbing, for 5 minutes. (No need to sear more than one side.) Transfer the pork to the slow cooker; after the second batch, deglaze the pan with the ¼ cup sherry vinegar and ½ cup red wine, stirring to scrape up any browned bits, then scrape the mixture into the slow cooker. Proceed from there as the recipe directs.

Heat the oil in a medium Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high until the oil shimmers. Add the shallots, and stir until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic, lemongrass and 1 tablespoon grated ginger. Stir and cook until fragrant, 1 minute.

Tamarind can be found as a purée or paste, in varying degrees of concentration. First taste the store-bought tamarind to determine how acidic it is and how much to use in the soup. Tamarind pods or pulp can also be bought to make the purée at home. All options are available at African, Caribbean or Asian grocery stores.

1½
tablespoons white vinegar
½
cup nondairy milk, plus more as needed
¼
cup vegan butter
2
tablespoons nutritional yeast

Chopped chives (optional), for serving","149 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In an oven-safe skillet or baking dish large enough to hold the potatoes, toss together the chopped onions, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon water and pinches of salt and pepper. Using a fork, poke holes all over the potatoes. In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and a pinch of salt.
Step 2
Place the onions on the bottom rack of the oven and the potatoes directly on the top rack above the onions. (This way, any drips from the potatoes will land on the onions instead of the bottom of your oven.) Reserve the bowl. Roast, stirring the onions halfway through, until the onions are softened and browned in spots, 30 to 40 minutes, and the potatoes offer no resistance when a knife is inserted in their centers, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove from the oven when each is finished and let the potatoes sit until cool enough to handle. (If your potatoes are dripping, place a piece of aluminum foil on the lower rack to catch any drips once the onions below have been removed.) Leave the oven on.
Step 3
While the potatoes and onions roast, stir the vinegar into the milk.
Step 4
When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, slice the top third lengthwise off the potatoes. Scoop out most of the flesh, leaving a ¼-inch border of flesh on the skin, and transfer the flesh to the reserved bowl. Scrape the potato tops of all flesh and add the flesh to the bowl. Snack on, compost or discard the top skins.
Step 5
Season the potato filling generously with salt and pepper, then add the butter and nutritional yeast. Mash with a fork or potato masher until smooth, but don’t overwork. Add the onions and milk mixture; stir to combine. (Reserve the skillet.) If the mixture is stiff or dry, add more milk; season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 6
Mound each potato boat with the filling, then transfer to the reserved skillet, filling side up. Bake the potatoes until warmed through and dry to the touch, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with chives, if using.

Pat chicken dry, then season liberally with salt and pepper on both sides.
Step 2
Zest 1 lemon, reserving the zest for the bread crumbs, then halve the lemon and squeeze all its juice into a medium bowl. Add the eggs to the juice and beat to combine. Add the seasoned chicken and turn to coat. Let rest while you make the sauce and bread crumb mixture.
Step 3
Prepare the sauce: In a medium bowl, combine the zest and juice of the remaining 2 lemons; stir in ¼ cup of the parsley. Set aside.
Step 4
Prepare the bread crumbs: In a shallow dish, combine bread crumbs, flour, cheese, oregano and the remaining parsley. Add the reserved lemon zest and, using a fork, press the zest into the bread crumb mixture to combine evenly.
Step 5
Working one at a time, press each chicken breast into the bread crumb mixture, using your fingers to help thoroughly coat it on both sides; place on a sheet pan.
Step 6
Heat about ⅓ cup of oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Working in batches, leaving 1 to 2 inches of space between, add 2 to 3 chicken pieces and cook until golden brown, turning once, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining chicken, adding and heating more oil as needed.
Step 7
While the first batch of chicken is frying, heat ⅓ cup olive oil in a small saucepan on medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just long enough for the garlic to sizzle but not brown. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
Step 8
Once all the chicken is plated, slowly pour the garlic oil into the lemon and parsley mixture and whisk to combine. Before serving, spoon the salmoriglio sauce liberally over the chicken.

tablespoons finely grated Parmesan","503 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Heat oven to 325 degrees. In a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium. Add onion and 1 teaspoon salt. Sauté until onions are pale gold at the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of the onions to a small bowl and set aside for the cabbage.
Step 2
Add rice and 1 cup stock to the onions in the pan and bring to a simmer. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is about halfway cooked (it should still be a bit firm), 8 to 10 minutes.
Step 3
In a large bowl, combine the herbs, scallions and lemon zest, and mix well. Transfer ¼ cup of the herb-lemon zest mixture to a small bowl and stir in the yogurt, ½ teaspoon garlic and a large pinch of salt; refrigerate until serving.
Step 4
When the rice is ready, add it to the bowl with the herbs and mix well. Add the pork, ½ teaspoon salt and remaining garlic, and gently mix to combine. Add the egg and mix to combine.
Step 5
In the same skillet (you don’t need to wash it), melt butter and heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium. Add the cabbage and reserved sautéed onions. (If it doesn’t all fit, you can let some of the cabbage wilt and shrink, then add the rest.) Season cabbage with 1 teaspoon salt and sauté until wilted, about 5 minutes. Cover and let cook until tender, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Uncover and cook until the cabbage starts to brown, about 3 to 5 minutes more.
Step 6
Transfer half of the softened cabbage to a medium bowl. Spread cabbage in the pan in an even layer. Dollop the pork mixture evenly on the cabbage.Top the pork with the remaining cabbage. Add remaining ½ cup stock and the lemon juice. Cover the pan and bake until the cabbage is very tender, about 1 hour.
Step 7
Remove the skillet from the oven and turn on the broiler. Uncover pan, sprinkle the cabbage with Parmesan, then broil until nicely browned on top, 1 to 3 minutes. Top cabbage with more herbs and serve with the yogurt sauce.
You can substitute green or red cabbage, just add 5 to 10 minutes to the cooking time in Step 5. The cabbage should be very soft before you add the pork.

cups plus 1 tablespoon/333 milliliters whole milk
4½
cups/535 grams bread flour (preferably King Arthur)
¾
teaspoon fine salt
For the Filling
1
(7-ounce/198-gram) package Odense almond paste
2
cups/480 milliliters heavy whipping cream, plus 3 tablespoons (or more as needed)
½
cup/62 grams confectioners’ sugar, plus more for garnish
1
teaspoon vanilla extract","210 user ratings","1 hour, plus rising ","Step 1
Prepare the dough: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Weigh the cane sugar and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer; add the cardamom.
Step 2
Once the butter has melted, add the milk to the saucepan and allow it to warm up just slightly. The Swedes call this fingervarm, just above body temp. Add the milk-butter mixture to the bowl of the stand mixer and allow to sit for a couple of minutes, stirring once to combine.
Step 3
Once the yeast starts to dissolve and activate (you’ll see foam starting to appear on the surface), add the flour and salt. Mix on low speed with a dough hook until combined, then increase the mixing speed to medium and allow to mix for 3 to 5 minutes, until the dough is soft and smooth.
Step 4
Remove the dough from the mixer and knead into one large ball and allow to rest in a large bowl, covered with plastic wrap, until roughly doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
Step 5
Use a bench scraper or sharp knife to portion the dough into individual buns, each weighing 100 grams. If there is any dough left over, divide it into pieces and add to the rest.
Step 6
To shape, flatten a portion of dough and fold the edges in toward the center to create surface tension in the dough, flip over so the seam you have created is facing down and roll clockwise with a cupped palm to form a tight ball. Repeat with each piece. Place onto parchment-lined baking sheets with about 3 inches of space between each bun. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise until almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes.
Step 7
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the plastic wrap and bake for 12 to 14 minutes, rotating the pans and switching their position halfway through baking. The buns should be golden and have a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom when done. Transfer to a cooling rack and let sit until cool enough to handle.
Step 8
While buns are baking, prepare the filling: Add the almond paste to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add about 3 tablespoons of heavy cream and mix until it has a spreadable consistency (you may need more cream); transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
Step 9
Once the filling is made, using a clean mixing bowl and the whisk attachment, combine the rest of the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar and vanilla and whip the cream to stiff peaks. Transfer the cream to a piping bag fitted with a large star tip.
Step 10
To assemble the buns, begin by cutting the top third of the buns off horizontally and save the tops. Using your fingers, hollow out a small portion of the center of the buns and fill with about a tablespoon of the almond filling. Using an offset spatula, spread the paste to reach the edges of the cut portion of the bun.
Step 11
Use the piping bag to pipe the whipped cream into a swirl on top of the almond filling. (Don’t be afraid to go high!)
Step 12
After the semlor are all filled, cut the reserved tops into triangle shapes and place them on top of the whipped cream. Sprinkle the semlor with confectioners’ sugar to serve.

2
tablespoons granulated sugar

Pinch of salt

Food coloring (optional), preferably purple, green and pink gel food coloring, for vibrant color

Neutral oil or unsalted butter, for greasing the pan","42 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Prepare the filling: Place the coconut, ground cardamom and sugar into a medium bowl; mix well and set aside.
Step 2
Prepare the pancakes: In a separate medium bowl, stir together the flour, milk, egg, sugar and salt to make a thin batter. If you desire colorful pancakes, split the batter into four bowls: One bowl can be left as the original color, then add ¾ cup batter to each of three separate bowls to brighten with food coloring as you please. (Purple, green and pink are common options.) Stir each colored batter to combine.
Step 3
Heat a crepe pan or 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium. Grease the pan with some oil or butter to coat, wipe off excess.
Step 4
Pour about ⅓ cup of batter into the pan and tilt the pan in a circular motion to spread the batter evenly all around. The pancakes should be thin, like crepes. Cook until the edges are dry and only the middle appears slightly wet, about 2 minutes. (Cook time will vary, depending on the thickness of the batter in the pan.) Flip pancake over and cook for about 1 additional minute.
Step 5
As pancakes are done, transfer them to a plate. Continue making pancakes until the batter is done, adding additional oil or butter between pancakes and lowering the heat as necessary.
Step 6
Set a pancake on a flat surface, spotted side up if one side is darker than the other. Place about ¼ cup of filling in the center of the pancake, arranged in a log. Fold the top flap down to cover the filling, then repeat with the bottom flap. Carefully transfer to a serving plate, flap side down. Repeat with remaining pancakes and filling and serve.

Pass the flour, baking powder and salt through a sieve into a medium bowl. Add egg and about half the milk; beat well. Add the remaining milk, beat again, and leave the batter to stand for 10 minutes.
Step 2
Pour 1 tablespoon of oil into a large nonstick pan and turn the heat to high. When hot, pour a thin layer of batter (about 3 tablespoons) into the pan. You should be able to fit two or three pancakes in a large pan.
Step 3
Add a tablespoon of butter into the pan for flavor as the pancakes are cooking and fry until bubbles appear on the top of the batter, about 1½ minutes.
Step 4
Lower the temperature to medium and flip the pancakes. Fry until golden brown, about 1 minute, then transfer to a plate.
Step 5
Repeat the process until all the batter is used, adding oil and butter as needed and wiping out any oil in the pan that becomes too dark along the way. The heat should be turned to high just before more batter is added, but then lowered to medium just before the pancakes are flipped.
Step 6
Serve each pancake with a pat of butter, a lemon slice and a generous sprinkling of sugar.

In a medium bowl, mix together Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning and garlic. Toss the beef with the marinade and let sit for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.
Step 2
As the beef marinates, heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Add celery, onion, bell pepper and salt. Sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, pepper, cayenne and ginger; sauté for another minute. Transfer the vegetables to small bowl.

4
large garlic cloves
1
medium white onion, cut into thick slices

Salt
3

3
large garlic cloves
1
teaspoon freshly ground cumin (optional)

Finely chopped white onion, crushed dried piquín chiles, lime wedges, dried Mexican oregano and warm corn tortillas, for serving","61 user ratings","3½ hours","Step 1
To prepare the broth: Combine 6 quarts water with the cow’s foot, marrow bones, garlic and onion in a very large stockpot (at least 12 quarts) and set over medium-high heat. Season with 1½ tablespoons salt. Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes. While it cooks, use a spoon to skim off any foam that forms on the surface.
Step 2
Add the tripe and oregano and cook for 2 to 2 ½ hours, until the tripe is tender but firm. (Do not overcook it.)
Step 3
Remove the cow’s foot and marrow bones from the pot and skim off the fat from the surface. Once the cow’s foot cools a little, pick off the meaty parts, chop them and return them to the pot, along with the marrow from the bones. Discard all the bones.
Step 4
While the broth is cooking, make the guajillo sauce: Heat a comal or large skillet over medium-high, then place the guajillo peppers open wide in the pan and lightly roast them for 30 to 40 seconds, until they darken slightly and become fragrant. Remove promptly. Place the roasted peppers in a bowl and cover them with water. Let them soak for about 25 minutes, until soft. Drain the peppers and place them in a blender with the garlic, ½ cup of the cooking broth and cumin (if using). Blend until smooth. Strain the sauce through a strainer into the pot with the broth.
Step 5
Simmer the broth for another 30 minutes, partially covered. Taste and season with more salt, if you like. Serve the soup in large bowls and place the chopped onion, crushed chiles, lime wedges, oregano and tortillas in serving dishes for everyone to add to their own bowls.
Cow’s feet are usually sold already cut in pieces. Look for pieces without hooves that have been cut. If the foot is whole, ask the butcher to cut it for you.
If you want your broth to have a darker color, add 2 ancho peppers (in addition to the guajillo peppers) to the sauce. Prepare them the same way as the guajillo peppers in step 4.

slices Muenster cheese
4
cornichons, thinly sliced lengthwise
2
tablespoons toum (prepared or homemade), plus more for dipping

Kosher salt","321 user ratings","15 minutes, plus 15 minutes for the toum (optional) ","Step 1
Prepare the toum (or proceed to Step 4, if using store-bought toum): Place garlic, lemon juice, kosher salt and 1 tablespoon water in a tall, narrow container; blend with an immersion blender until smooth. Let sit for at least 10 minutes to mellow out some of the raw garlic’s bite.
Step 2
Dump the neutral oil on top, then lower the immersion blender to the bottom of the container. Turn the blender on, but don’t yet move it. Once the mixture starts emulsifying and thickening, slowly tilt the blender to introduce more oil to the mixture and very slowly pull the blender to the top of the mix. Plunge the blender up and down until the toum is fully emulsified and thick. (This streamlined toum recipe sacrifices fluffiness for ease by using a stick blender. If you want to make perfectly fluffy toum, prepare this recipe using a food processor.)
Step 3
Stir well and adjust the toum with more salt and lemon juice as needed. (The toum recipe makes about 1¾ cups.) Transfer to a container with a tight-fitting lid and refrigerate, if not using immediately.
Step 4
Prepare the sandwich: Divide the cheese evenly between the two slices of bread, tearing one piece in half to split it. Shingle the cornichons in one even layer on one side. Carefully close the sandwich. Evenly spread 1 tablespoon of toum on one side of the sandwich.
Step 5
In a medium nonstick skillet, place the sandwich, toum-side down. Press the sandwich firmly with a spatula to compress. Cook over medium-low until lightly golden underneath, 5 to 6 minutes.
Step 6
Spread 1 tablespoon of toum on the top side of the bread, then flip the sandwich over and press firmly. Cook until bread is lightly golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, then flip back over. Since toum is made of mostly garlic, it burns easily. Take your time, reducing the heat to low, flipping and pressing the sandwich often to ensure that the cheese melts evenly and the bread doesn’t burn, about 3 more minutes. Lightly season both sides with salt and serve immediately, with a side of toum for dipping.

large eggs
1
cup/150 grams mochiko (sweet rice flour), such as Blue Star brand","632 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Spray an 8-inch square cake pan with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 2
To a large microwave-proof bowl, add the butter and chocolate and microwave on high for 1 minute. Give it a quick stir and microwave for another 15 seconds. Stir well until the chocolate is all melted and well combined with the butter.
Step 3
To the chocolate and butter, add the sugar and stir well until combined. Add the eggs and stir (or use a whisk but a wooden spoon or flexible spatula is fine) until the eggs are completely combined. Lastly, add the mochiko and stir until you have a thick batter. Pour into the prepared pan, then tap it against the counter to get rid of any air bubbles. Scatter with a few more chocolate chips.
Step 4
Place in the oven and bake until the center is dry to the touch but with a slight wobble when you press it, about 30 minutes. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack. Use the parchment paper to slide the cooled mochi brownie out of the pan and allow to cool completely, 1 to 1 ½ hours. Cut the brownie into 16 pieces. (Mochi brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or frozen for 3 months. To reheat from frozen, microwave for 30 seconds or longer until warm.)

"Cassava Oven Fries","Vegetables,Grapeseed Oil,Party,Yuca,Dinner,Snack,Side Dish,Vegan,Super Bowl","Yield: 4 Servings","2
medium fresh cassava (2½ to 3 pounds)

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
6
tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed","142 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.
Step 2
Fill a large bowl with water. Trim and discard the ends of the cassava. Peel off the brown skin on the cassava with a sharp peeler or paring knife. Cut the cassava crosswise into thirds and slice each piece lengthwise into ½-inch-wide pieces. Cut each slice into ½-inch sticks and transfer to the bowl of water as you go to avoid discoloration.
Step 3
Once the water in the pot is boiling, season it with 2 tablespoons of salt. Drop the cassava sticks carefully into the pot. Cook until the cassava is just beginning to soften and the surface becomes translucent, 45 to 90 seconds. Using a slotted spoon or sieve, transfer the cassava to a baking sheet. Pat the pieces dry with a clean towel and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes.
Step 4
Gently toss the cassava sticks with 4 tablespoons oil on the baking sheet. Roast for 15 minutes, until just beginning to brown on the bottoms. Remove from the oven and use a spatula to toss the cassava with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Spread the sticks out again, flipping the pieces so the browned sides are up. Sprinkle lightly with salt and return to the oven. Roast until the cassava is golden and crisp, 10 to15 minutes. Serve the fries immediately while still hot.

cup plus 2 tablespoons/270 milliliters heavy cream
2
Earl Grey tea bags or 2 teaspoons loose-leaf tea
2
tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling
¼
cup/38 grams finely chopped bittersweet chocolate, not chips
3
large egg yolks

Pinch of salt","309 user ratings","45 minutes, plus 2 hours’ cooling ","Step 1
Heat oven to 300 degrees. Set two 8-ounce shallow ramekins in a baking pan with sides at least 2 inches tall.
Step 2
Add the cream to a small saucepan set over medium heat and warm until just bubbling around the edges. Turn off the heat, add the tea and let steep for 10 minutes. Remove the tea bags, pressing to extract all of the liquid into the pan. If using tea leaves, strain out the leaves and return the cream to the pan.
Step 3
Add the 2 tablespoons/25 grams of granulated sugar and return the pan to the heat, stirring occasionally, until it comes to a gentle simmer and the sugar dissolves. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the chocolate until smooth.
Step 4
Add the egg yolks and salt to a medium bowl and whisk until smooth. Slowly stream the warm chocolate mixture into the eggs while whisking continuously. Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve into a container with a spout, for easy pouring.
Step 5
Slowly pour the mixture into the ramekins, dividing evenly. If the custard has large air bubbles floating on the top, use a kitchen torch on a low setting to pop the bubbles. Fill a kettle or container with a spout with about 3 cups of hot tap water.
Step 6
Gently place the pan in the oven. Carefully pour the hot tap water into the pan until it comes about halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake the custards until just set but slightly wiggly in the center, 22 to 25 minutes.
Step 7
Remove the pan from the oven and carefully use a spatula to remove the custards from the water bath and set them on a rack to cool. Once they are cool enough to handle, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate the custards until completely cool, at least 2 hours.
Step 8
When you are ready to serve, sprinkle the top of each custard with a thin layer of sugar; you’ll need 1 to 3 teaspoons, depending on the width of your ramekins. Use a kitchen torch held about ½ inch above the custards to melt and caramelize the sugar. Move the torch slowly over the entire surface of the custard to evenly melt then caramelize the sugar until it is deep golden brown. Let the sugar cool for a minute or two then serve. You can make the custards up to 2 days in advance; let the chilled custard sit at room temperature for about 15 minutes so it can soften slightly before you torch the top just before serving.

1
(12- to 16-ounce) boneless steak, such as filet mignon or strip steak, about 1-inch thick
2
tablespoons unsalted butter
1
tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or safflower
2
tablespoons minced shallot or red onion
1

1
teaspoon Dijon mustard
1
teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
½
teaspoon fish sauce (optional)

Minced chives or parsley, for garnish","859 user ratings","15 minutes, plus 15 to 30 minutes’ resting","Step 1
Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the steak and set aside at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes.
Step 2
Melt the butter and heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium-high. Pat the steak dry with a paper towel. Increase the heat to high, add the steak to the pan and sear until well browned, about 2 minutes. Turn and sear on the other side and cook until done to taste, 1 to 4 minutes longer. If your steak is thick enough, insert an instant-read thermometer in the center to test the temperature: Rare is 125 degrees; medium rare is 135 degrees; medium is 145 degrees. When the steak is done, move it to a cutting board and tent with an overturned bowl or foil to keep warm.
Step 3
Add shallot to the pan and sauté until golden, 2 to 3 minutes on medium-high heat, stirring once or twice. Stir in the tomato paste, mixing well and letting it deepen in color, about 1 minute.
Step 4
Turn off the heat and add the Cognac to deglaze the pan. Using a long match or stick lighter, set the Cognac on fire, standing back and taking care. Let the flames burn out, then turn the heat to medium-high and cook until the Cognac is almost evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes.
Step 5
Stir in the cream, mustard, Worcestershire and fish sauce, if using, and cook until thickened, about 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle the warm sauce over the steak — you can slice beforehand if you wish — and garnish with black pepper and herbs.

8
ounces fresh sweet cherries, pitted (about 1¾ cups)
2
tablespoons Cognac or brandy

Salt

Ice cream or pound cake, for serving","150 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
Finely grate about ¼ teaspoon zest from the orange, then halve the fruit and squeeze out 2 tablespoons juice. Place the cardamon pods on a cutting board and use the side of a chef’s knife to lightly press on them, bruising them.
Step 2
In a medium skillet over medium heat, combine butter, sugar, cardamom seeds and pods, and orange juice. Gently stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves, 2 to 3 minutes.
Step 3
Add the cherries and orange zest to the saucepan. Cook cherries until they become tender and release their juices, 2 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and leave the pan on the stove.
Step 4
Pour Cognac or brandy into a big metal ladle capable of holding 2 tablespoons of liquid, or a small saucepan. With a stick lighter or long match, carefully warm the brandy by gliding the flame directly over the liquid (stand back as you do this). When the brandy is warm enough, it will ignite with blue flames. Immediately pour the flaming brandy over the cherries and allow flames to burn off, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Step 5
After the flames have died, turn the burner to medium heat and reduce the sauce until it begins to thicken, 1 to 2 minutes. Add a tiny pinch of salt to taste and spoon warm cherries over ice cream or cake.

Lightly sweetened whipped cream or ice cream, to serve","746 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling ","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.
Step 2
In a large heat-safe bowl set over a pot of simmering water, or in a microwave, melt the butter and chocolate together; stir until smooth.
Step 3
Add ¼ cup/50 grams of the sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Separate 4 of the eggs and add the yolks and remaining whole egg to the sugar in the stand mixer bowl. (Alternatively, you can use a large bowl and handheld electric mixer.) Beat on medium-high speed until light in color, foamy and about doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. The egg mixture should fall from the whisk in ribbons.
Step 4
Add the egg mixture to the melted chocolate mixture. Add the rum (if using), vanilla, espresso powder (if using) and salt; fold gently until combined and no streaks remain.
Step 5
Wash and dry the mixer bowl, add the remaining egg whites and beat on medium-high until foamy. Slowly add the remaining ¾ cup/150 grams sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, and beat until soft peaks form, about 4 minutes.
Step 6
Add about 1 cup of the egg white mixture to the chocolate mixture and fold until well combined. Add the remaining egg white mixture and fold gently until well combined. Transfer the batter to the pan and smooth the top.
Step 7
Bake the cake until puffed slightly over the edge of the pan and the edges are set but the center is still wobbly, 25 to 30 minutes.

Position an oven rack 6 inches from the broiler and another rack on the bottom of the oven. Heat the oven to 325 degrees. If you’d like to remove the membrane from the bony underside of the ribs, use a small knife to release one corner of the thin membrane, then pull off the rest with your hands and discard.
Step 2
In a small bowl, stir together the salt, onion powder and black pepper. Season the ribs on both sides with the spice mixture. Wrap the ribs tightly in aluminum foil as if wrapping a present, place on a sheet pan flesh-side down and bake on the bottom rack until the meat is tender and pulls away easily from the bones, 2 to 2½ hours.
Step 3
Remove the ribs from the oven, then heat the broiler. Unwrap the ribs and, reserving the foil with its juices, transfer the ribs to the sheet pan flesh-side up. Carefully tip the juices from the foil into a large skillet. Stir in the garlic, jelly, vinegar and soy sauce, and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the glaze is syrupy and reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat.

Drizzle the top of the rice with a little neutral oil. Now, using a spatula, break rice into large pieces and flip over, cooking the other side of the rice for 3 to 5 minutes until crispy. When ready, remove the first batch of crispy rice from the pan and repeat with the remaining rice.
Step 3
To serve, add the rice to bowls and serve with lettuce, lime, herbs and red chile on the side.

tablespoons malt vinegar
2
tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons deggi mirch (red chile powder)
1
tablespoon garam masala
1
teaspoon ground turmeric
½
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
4
teaspoons ginger-garlic paste","458 user ratings","45 minutes, plus 3 hours marinating","Step 1
Make the ginger-garlic paste: Using a blender or mini food processor, mince or blend the ginger and garlic to form a paste, adding water (about ¼ cup) as needed to thin. The ginger-garlic paste makes more than you’ll need (about ⅓ cup total) and will keep for 1 week in the refrigerator, or you can portion and freeze in an ice cube tray.
Step 2
Prepare the chicken: In a medium bowl, marinate the chicken with the malt vinegar, salt and 4 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste; let rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, prepare the yogurt marinade: In a medium bowl, stir together the yogurt, malt vinegar, deggi mirch, garam masala, turmeric, salt and 4 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste. Squeeze the chicken, discarding excess liquid, and add the chicken to the yogurt marinade; stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 3 to 4 hours. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before baking.
Step 4
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Set a wire rack over an aluminum foil-lined large baking sheet. Remove the chicken from the marinade and thread onto skewers. Place the skewers on the wire rack, spacing apart. Bake until the chicken is just starting to brown on the ends, about 15 minutes.
Step 5
Brush each skewer with the melted butter and continue baking until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes more. Serve with naan or roti, if you’d like.

1
cup grated fresh or low-moisture mozzarella (about 4 ounces)
1
shallot, thinly sliced
1
pound store-bought or homemade pizza dough, at room temperature","326 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Place a sheet pan on the oven’s lowest rack and heat the oven to 450 degrees. In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the heavy cream, Parmesan, lemon juice, garlic, nutmeg (if using), and red-pepper flakes. Season to taste with salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, sprinkle the kale with the olive oil and a big pinch of salt; squeeze with your hands until wilted.
Step 2
Place a kitchen towel on a work surface, then place an upside-down sheet pan or cutting board on the towel. (This will serve as your pizza peel; the towel stabilizes the setup as you roll the dough.) Line the upside-down sheet pan with parchment paper, lightly grease the parchment paper with olive oil and place the dough on top. Stretch or roll the dough on the parchment into a 9-by-13-inch rectangle. If the dough shrinks, let it rest a few minutes before continuing.
Step 3
Sprinkle the mozzarella over the dough, then add the kale in an even layer. Spoon the heavy cream over the kale, then top with the shallots.
Step 4
Remove the heated sheet pan from the oven and carefully slide the parchment with the dough onto the hot baking sheet. Cook until the cheese and the crust is golden brown, 14 to 16 minutes.
Step 5
Use tongs to transfer the pizza to a cooling rack, leaving the parchment behind. Let sit for a few minutes to crisp and cool slightly before cutting and serving.

Prepare the chili: Move a rack as close to the heating element as possible and heat the broiler. Cover a baking sheet with foil. Finely dice half of the onion and set aside for later.
Step 2
Slice remaining onion half into ½-inch-thick half-moons and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Place jalapeños and poblano next to onions, cut sides down. Lightly brush vegetables with oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Broil 2 to 4 minutes, until vegetables are charred on one side. (If the chiles are small, they will be charred after 1 to 2 minutes.) Flip vegetables and broil until the other side is charred, 1 to 3 minutes.
Step 3
Transfer pan to a rack until cool enough to handle, then stem the peppers. Transfer charred vegetables and any accumulated juices to a blender (or use a bowl and immersion blender). Add canned tomato and ¼ teaspoon salt, and blend to a coarse purée. You can make this up to 4 days ahead, and store in the refrigerator until needed.)
Step 4
Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a large Dutch oven, heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Add diced onion and sauté until lightly browned, 6 to 9 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chili powder, oregano, remaining 1½ teaspoons salt and cumin, and cook until spices darken, about 30 seconds.

To peel the citrus fruit, using a small serrated knife, cut off a thin slice of peel from the top and bottom of the orange, so it sits flat and securely on the cutting board. Cut from top to bottom, following the curve of the fruit. Remove only the peel and white pith, not the flesh of the orange. It should be perfectly spherical and naked.
Step 2
Slice navels and blood oranges crosswise into thin slices, picking out seeds if needed. Use a paring knife to section the grapefruit into suprèmes, cutting between the membranes. Reserve any citrus juices obtained in the process.
Step 3
To serve, arrange citrus on a serving platter or on individual plates. Scatter the shallot slices over the fruit, then add thinly sliced fennel and olives.

1¼
cups dry white wine (or substitute with lemon, see Tip)
4
cups vegetable stock (or chicken or beef broth)","810 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
On a cutting board, coarsely chop the garlic. Add the parsley and capers to the garlic; chop everything together until finely chopped. (You can also pulse the mixture in the food processor, if that’s easier for you.) Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the red-pepper flakes. Reserve the cutting board without cleaning it.
Step 2
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add a single layer of the broccoli and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to the reserved cutting board, then repeat with the remaining broccoli, adding more oil when the pot gets dry.
Step 3
To the now-empty pot, reduce the heat to medium and add 2 tablespoons oil. Add the onion, farro and half of the parsley-caper mixture (about ¼ cup, but no need to measure). Season with salt, then stir until the farro is darker in color and the garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine, increase heat to medium-high and scrape up browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Simmer until the wine is reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the stock and 2 cups of water; season lightly with salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer gently for 10 minutes.
Step 4
Meanwhile, coarsely chop the broccoli until small enough to fit on your spoon. After the farro has cooked for 10 minutes, add the broccoli and simmer until the farro and broccoli are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt.
Step 5
Divide among bowls; top with the remaining parsley-caper mixture and a drizzle of olive oil. Leftovers will keep for up to 3 days, but the soup will thicken as the farro continues to drink up the broth. You can thin leftovers with more stock, but the dish is actually better warm, like porridge, or cold, as a grain salad.
If you’d prefer not to use wine, you can mimic the brightness by finishing the soup with lemon zest and juice to taste.

Arrange a rack at the bottom of the oven and heat to 450 degrees. With the stalk end facing up, slice the cauliflower in half through the stalk, then when your knife reaches florets, pull the pieces apart.

On a sheet pan, toss the cauliflower pieces with the olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Spread in an even layer, cut sides down. Roast, undisturbed, on the bottom rack until golden brown on the underside, 15 to 20 minutes. (Check pieces in the middle of the pan, because pieces at the edges brown faster.)

Flip the cauliflower, sprinkle with the Parmesan, then roast until the cauliflower is tender and the Parmesan is melted and golden in spots, 7 to 10 minutes. Let cool a few minutes for the Parmesan to crisp. Use a spatula to transfer the cauliflower and any cheese on the sheet pan to plates.

"Pickle Soup (Ogórkowa Zupa)","Soups And Stews,Carrot,Dill,Pickle,Potato,Vegetable Broth","Yield: 6 to 8 servings","6 to 8
cups vegetable or chicken stock
3
large carrots, peeled and coarsely grated
3
large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces
1
small celery root, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces
1
medium parsnip, peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces
7
sour dill pickles (8 to 9 ounces) with 1½ cups brine from the jar (see Tip)
3
tablespoons unsalted butter
4
garlic cloves, finely chopped
3
dried bay leaves

Salt and black pepper
¼
cup sour cream, for serving (optional)

Chopped fresh dill, for serving (optional)","719 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
In a large pot, combine 6 cups stock with the carrots, potatoes, celery root and parsnip. The vegetables should be covered with stock, so add more as needed. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and reduce the heat to medium-low. Rapidly simmer until all of the vegetables are fork tender, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
Step 2
While the vegetables are cooking, coarsely grate the pickles. You should have about 1 cup densely packed grated pickles. Melt the butter in a small frying pan over medium heat until it starts to brown. Stir in the garlic and bay leaves, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the grated pickles and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook, stirring once, until the pickles become softer, 8 to 12 minutes.
Step 3
Add the pickle mixture to the pot with the vegetables, along with 1 cup pickle brine. Taste, then season with salt and pepper. The soup should already be salty from the broth, pickles and their brine, so add salt carefully. Add up to ½ cup more brine if you want a more sour taste. Remove and discard the bay leaves.
Step 4
If using sour cream, temper the cream so it doesn’t curdle: In a cup, mix the sour cream with 1 to 2 tablespoons of cold water, stirring well after each addition, then repeat with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the soup. Add the tempered cream to the pot. Bring to a simmer and heat through, about 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.
Step 5
To serve, ladle the soup into bowls. Top with chopped dill and black pepper.
If looking for Polish pickles, be sure to buy ogórki kiszone (cucumbers in brine), such as those sold by the Polonaise brand. Do not buy Polish dill pickles (ogórki konserwowe). If substituting other pickles, use dill pickles that are low in vinegar.

cups loosely packed katsuobushi (often labeled “bonito flakes”)
1
(14-ounce) package silken tofu, drained
¼
cup miso (white or red; see Tip), plus more to taste
1
large scallion, thinly sliced","601 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Make dashi, the soup base, by soaking kombu in 4 cups cold water for 15 minutes in a medium pot. Add the sake and mirin and bring to a simmer over high heat. As soon as the water starts to boil, take the pot off the heat, cover and let the kombu steep until the liquid smells like the sea, about 15 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, soak the wakame in about 3 inches of cold water until soft, about 15 minutes as well. Drain and set aside.
Step 3
When ready to serve, remove the kombu from the pot (see Tip). Stir the katsuobushi into the kombu broth, cover and let steep for 1 minute. Strain into a medium bowl, pressing down on the katsuobushi to extract all of the liquid; discard the spent flakes. This is your dashi.
Step 4
Return the dashi to the pot and add the drained wakame. Scoop the tofu into the pot using a spoon or your hand, leaving it in large chunks. Bring the soup to a boil, then remove from the heat.
Step 5
Add the miso to a small bowl, then ladle over some of the broth and stir to dissolve. Add the dissolved miso to the pot and gently stir until incorporated. Add the scallion, taste for seasoning (adding more miso if you’d like) and serve immediately.
White, or shiro, miso is made with a higher proportion of rice, which lends a milder, sweeter flavor, whereas red, or aka, miso, is made with more soybeans, resulting in a bolder, more umami-rich taste and a darker color as well.
You can discard the simmered kombu or thinly slice it into strips and add to pastas, soups, stews and salads for added vegetal heft.

"Crispy Smashed Chicken Breasts With Gin and Sage","Poultry,Chicken Breast,Gin,Sage,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 6 servings","24
sage leaves
3
large skin-on chicken breasts
6
garlic cloves, smashed and peeled

Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
3
tablespoons olive oil
3
tablespoons cold butter
¼
cup gin
¾
cup chicken stock, preferably homemade
1 to 2
tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus wedges for serving","1631 user ratings","1 hour, plus 1 hour marinating","Step 1
Rinse the sage leaves and dry thoroughly with a towel. If the chicken breasts have the rib cage attached, remove it — and any other bones — with a sharp knife (or ask your butcher to do it for you). Don’t trim off any skin or fat. Set each chicken breast skin side down on a cutting board and pound with a large meat mallet to even out the hump, flattening the chicken to an even thickness.
Step 2
Put the chicken in a large bowl or baking dish and add the garlic cloves, 12 sage leaves, ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Turn the chicken to coat evenly in the seasonings, then arrange the chicken skin side up on top of the garlic and sage in a single layer. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.
Step 3
Heat the olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a very large stainless steel sauté pan over medium-low. When the butter melts, add remaining 12 sage leaves and fry, turning and flipping them gently with a fork, until crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove the crispy sage to a plate.
Step 4
Turn the heat to medium and add the chicken, skin side down, along with its garlic and sage. Cook the chicken slowly but steadily, lowering the heat if the oil starts to smoke, until the skin crisps and turns a deep caramel color and the white sign of doneness creeps two-thirds of the way up the sides of the breasts, 25 to 30 minutes. Be prepared to stay stoveside, pressing on the chicken with a spatula to force contact with the pan and moving the chicken when it releases naturally from the pan for even cooking. Remove any garlic cloves or sage leaves that threaten to burn and save them for the sauce.
Step 5
When the chicken skin has turned dark amber, flip the chicken, lower the heat to medium-low and cook gently until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Turn off the heat. The residual heat will continue to cook the chicken while you finish the sauce.
Step 6
Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and add the gin to the pan. Turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 seconds to burn off the sharpness, then add the chicken stock and cook, scraping at the browned residue on the bottom of the pan to loosen it, until the liquid has reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. (You should have about ½ cup of sauce.) Add the lemon juice, any reserved garlic cloves and the remaining 2 tablespoons cold butter. Remove from the heat and swirl the pan to emulsify the sauce; taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.
Step 7
Move the chicken breasts to a cutting board and slice crosswise, taking care to cut neatly through the skin, then return to the platter. Pour the sauce around the perimeter of the platter — not over the chicken, which would dampen and soften the crispy skin — and top with the crispy sage leaves. Garnish with lemon wedges and serve immediately.

Prepare the meatballs: In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, rice, mint, garlic, salt and pepper. Using your hands, gently mix until well combined. Pinch off 2-ounce portions and gently roll between your palms to form golf ball-size rounds, transferring rounds to a sheet pan. (You should have about 28 meatballs.)
Step 2
In large pot, combine the olive oil, onion, carrots, celery and potato; season with salt and pepper. Cook over medium-high, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomato paste, garlic, bay leaves, oregano and cumin, and cook over medium, stirring frequently, until fragrant and tomato paste starts to caramelize, about 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and tomato sauce and bring to a simmer over high.
Step 3
Once the stock begins to bubble, reduce the heat to medium-low. Carefully add the meatballs, one by one, distributing them evenly in the pot until they’re all submerged. If necessary, reduce the heat to reach a low simmer (this will keep the meatballs tender), and cook until the meatballs and rice are cooked through, about 40 minutes. (Resist the urge to stir for the first 20 minutes, otherwise you risk breaking the meatballs apart before they’ve firmed up.) Skim any impurities from the surface as the soup simmers.
Step 4
Season to taste with salt. Divide the soup among bowls, about 4 or 5 meatballs per portion, and set out bowls of whatever garnishes you like.

Mash the soup coarsely with a potato masher or give it a few quick blitzes with an immersion blender (watch out for the thyme sprigs). If you’d prefer a smoother soup, blitz until nearly smooth. Add the remaining ½ pound split peas and simmer about 1 hour, or until the peas are soft. If at any point the soup looks too thick, add more stock or water; if it looks too thin, remove the lid during the second simmer until it thickens. If using ham hocks, remove any meat from the bone, cut it into small cubes and stir into the soup. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with crumbled bacon, if using, and lemon wedges.

Peel and cut the yuca, yautia, green plantain and yellow plantain into 1-inch pieces. Scrape out the seeds, then chop the calabaza, skin on, into 1-inch pieces. Put each ingredient in a separate bowl, adding water to cover vegetables in order to prevent them from turning brown while you prepare the rest of the soup.
Step 2
Husk the corn, then slice it into 2-inch-thick segments. Set aside.
Step 3
Season pork (or beef) and chicken with ½ tablespoon salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper.
Step 4
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pot over medium-high. Add the pork and brown on all sides for 5 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a clean, large bowl, then add the chicken to the same pot, and brown on both sides for another 5 minutes, adding oil as needed if the pot gets dry. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the same bowl as the pork.
Step 5
Reduce heat to medium and add sofrito to the pot, scraping up any browned bits of meat and incorporating them into the mix. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, until liquid has evaporated and mixture darkens in color.
Step 6
Return the pork, chicken and any accumulated juices to the pot. Add the stock, bay leaves and remaining 1 tablespoon salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. Once simmering, reduce heat to medium-low and cook uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Step 7
To keep the vegetables from falling apart, add each one in order of firmness, cooking each for 5 minutes before adding the next. Begin with the yuca, then yautia, green plantain, yellow plantain, calabaza and corn, cooking the yuca for a total of 30 minutes and the corn for only 5 minutes.
Step 8
Add chorizo and stir well to incorporate. Cook for another 10 to 15 minutes over medium-low heat until meat and vegetables are tender and break easily with a fork. Because of all the starches and meat in this dish, this stew tends to be thick and rich. Some of the vegetables will fall apart, giving it a porridge consistency. This is a good thing.
Step 9
Adjust salt to taste, and serve with fresh bread or white rice on the side.
Root vegetables such as yuca and yautia can be difficult to find in some supermarkets, though you may be able to find them in the freezer section. Farmers’ markets, or Hispanic, Caribbean or Asian supermarkets are your best bet. There’s no real substitute for the rich, earthy flavor of these tubers, but potatoes can be used. If using potatoes, reduce the cooking time.

1
(13.5-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
¼
cup chopped fresh cilantro

Steamed rice, for serving","678 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut along the length of each prawn deep enough to expose and remove the vein. Place the fish chunks in a large bowl and season with 1 teaspoon salt. Squeeze in the juice of 1 lime and toss to coat. Set the prawns and fish aside while preparing the sauce.
Step 2
In a large, shallow Dutch oven or large, deep skillet, melt 2 tablespoons dendê oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, 1 minute. Add the onion, stir and cook, stirring until translucent, about 2 minutes.
Step 3
Increase the heat to high, add the peppers, tomatoes and chile. Season with salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the peppers are softened and any liquid from the tomatoes is beginning to evaporate, 4 minutes.
Step 4
Pour in the coconut milk, stir and reduce the heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid thickens and reduces to a creamy sauce, about 10 minutes. Taste, adjust the salt, if necessary, and stir in 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro.
Step 5
Carefully place the prawns in the sauce in a single layer and cook for 2 minutes. Turn the prawns to cook the other sides and add the cod. (Discard any juices in the bowl.) The fish will be partly submerged. Cook until the fish is tender and just cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes.
Step 6
Remove from heat, drizzle in the remaining 1 tablespoon dendê oil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro. Slice the remaining lime into wedges. Serve immediately, with steamed rice and lime wedges for squeezing.
Dendê oil, also known as red palm oil, is available online or at West African or Caribbean markets.

1
cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella (4 ounces)
¼
teaspoon dried oregano
2

Make the soup: Dump the canned tomatoes and their juices into a medium pot and, using your hands, tear into coarse chunks. Swish the broth in the empty tomato can and add to the pot.
Step 2
Stir in the onion, butter, oregano and sugar, and season generously with salt and pepper. Turn the heat to high and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until the onion is tender and the tomatoes have broken down, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the sandwiches: Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on one side of each of the 4 bread slices and evenly sprinkle the cheese and a little oregano on top of the mayonnaise. Top with the cheeseless slices, mayonnaise-side down.
Step 4
Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium. Add the sandwiches and cook until golden brown on the bottoms, 2 to 3 minutes. Melt the remaining tablespoon of butter in the pan, then flip the sandwiches with a spatula, move them around to coat with the butter and cook until the other side is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn heat to lowest setting to keep sandwiches warm.
Step 5
Carefully purée the tomato soup using a blender until smooth and creamy, adding more broth if needed to loosen to your desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the grilled cheeses to a cutting board and cut each in half diagonally. Serve alongside the soup.

⅛
teaspoon ground cayenne
⅛
teaspoon garlic powder
¾
cup sour cream, plus more for serving
¾
cup freshly grated Cheddar (about 3 ounces), plus more for serving","2474 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
In a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, cook the bacon (if using) until crisp, 12 to 13 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper-towel lined plate or cutting board. Return the pot with just 3 tablespoons of the bacon fat to the stove. (If there’s not enough fat, supplement with butter to total 3 tablespoons.) If making the soup vegetarian, melt butter in a large soup pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
Step 2
Over medium-low heat, sauté the white parts of the scallions and the garlic until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently and adjusting the heat as necessary to avoid burning the garlic. Add the potatoes, milk and 2 teaspoons salt, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat (resist the urge to heat it faster as this can lead to curdling). Once at a boil, lower the heat and simmer covered until the potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 3
As soup simmers, prepare the potato skins: Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Working in batches if needed, add the potato peels in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until crisp and golden-brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate or cutting board, then sprinkle with salt, pepper, cayenne and garlic powder. Crumble and set aside.
Step 4
Once the potatoes are tender, take the pot off the heat, and purée the mixture with an immersion blender if you’d like a smooth soup. (Mash with a potato masher if you’d like a chunkier soup.) Stir in the sour cream and cheese until combined, then season with salt and pepper. Serve topped with crumbled bacon, more sour cream and Cheddar and the green parts of the scallions. Top with potato peels (eat any extra as chips, dipped in ketchup and mustard).

teaspoon fresh lemon zest plus up to ½ cup lemon juice (from 2 to 3 lemons)
1
small garlic clove
1
tablespoon unsalted butter (optional)","5464 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
In a large Dutch oven or pot, combine the broth, chicken, celery and rice. Season lightly with salt. (Some broths have more salt than others, so start easy.) Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the rice starts to break down and lose its shape, 20 to 30 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, finely chop together the parsley leaves, lemon zest and up to ½ cup celery leaves. Transfer to a small bowl, grate the garlic clove into the bowl, season with salt and stir to combine.
Step 3
Using tongs, remove the chicken from the pot and transfer to a medium bowl. Using two forks, shred the chicken into pieces, then stir it back into the soup. Remove from heat, stir in the butter (if using), and season to taste with salt. Stir in the lemon juice a little at a time until the soup is bright but still tastes like chicken. (You may not use the full ½ cup juice.)
Step 4
Divide the soup among bowls and top with the parsley-lemon mixture. (The soup, minus the lemon juice and parsley mixture, can be refrigerated for up to 3 days; the rice will absorb liquid as it sits, so add more chicken broth when reheating. Add the lemon juice and fresh herb garnish just before serving.)

Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Place squash on a rimmed baking sheet, and toss with oil, honey, ¾ teaspoon salt and a lot of black pepper. Spread squash into an even layer, and roast until tender and caramelized, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating halfway through. Taste a squash cube and add more salt, pepper and honey if it seems flat.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the dressing: Place yogurt, herbs, lemon juice, oil, scallions, avocado, jalapeño and garlic in a food processor or blender, and process until smooth and uniformly green, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and season with salt, pepper and more lemon juice as needed. It should taste bright and tangy. Set aside.
Step 3
To assemble the salad, in a large bowl, combine radicchio, salad greens and roasted squash. Pour enough dressing over salad to lightly coat it, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Lightly drizzle with olive oil and a little more lemon juice, if you’d like, and serve immediately, with more dressing on the side.

½
cup grated Pecorino Romano, (about 3 ounces), plus more as needed
1½
tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more as needed
3
garlic cloves, finely grated or minced","665 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Cut about 1¼ pounds brussels sprouts in half lengthwise, and put them on a rimmed sheet pan along with any leaves that fell off as you were cutting. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and a large pinch of salt and black pepper. Toss well, then spread sprouts in an even layer. Roast until golden brown and tender, about 12 to 20 minutes, tossing halfway through.
Step 2
On another baking sheet, toss bread pieces with 2 tablespoons olive oil to coat evenly. Spread in an even layer, sprinkle with salt, and bake in the same oven as the brussels sprouts, until crunchy and evenly browned, about 14 to 18 minutes, tossing halfway through. Taste a crouton and add more salt if needed. Let croutons cool on the baking sheet.
Step 3
As the sprouts and croutons roast, use a food processor fitted with the slicing disk, or a chef’s knife, to thinly slice the remaining ¾ pound brussels sprouts. Place slices in a large bowl.
Step 4
Make the dressing: In a small bowl, combine cheese, lemon juice, garlic, ¾ teaspoon salt and several grinds of black pepper. Slowly whisk in remaining ⅓ cup olive oil until emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning by adding more salt, lemon juice or pepper, if needed.
Step 5
Pour just enough of the dressing over shaved raw brussels sprouts to coat them. Using your hands, massage dressing into the sprouts. Taste and add more dressing if needed.
Step 6
Add croutons and roasted brussels sprouts to the bowl and toss well. Taste and season with more cheese, salt, olive oil and lemon juice to taste. The salad should be lively in flavor and nicely coated in dressing, but not oily. Serve immediately.

2 to 3

2 to 3
whole cloves, crushed","557 user ratings","3 hours, plus at least 5 hours’ rising and 30 minutes’ resting","Step 1
Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add the warm water and sprinkle in the yeast. Add 2 tablespoons/15 grams flour from the measured amount and stir to combine. Let stand until foamy, about 6 minutes.
Step 2
Add the remaining flour and the salt, and, using a wooden spoon or spatula, stir the mixture just until it forms a shaggy dough. Add the butter and sesame oil (if using), and turn the mixer to the lowest speed. Mix, scraping down the dough hook as needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic, 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a bowl or freezer bag. Cover or seal and transfer to the refrigerator. Allow the dough to slowly rise until doubled in size, 5 hours and up to 12.
Step 3
While the dough rises, prepare the butter for lamination: In the bowl of the stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the butter, sugar and salt on low speed until incorporated, about 3 minutes. Transfer the butter mixture to a sheet of parchment paper and, using an offset or rubber spatula, spread into a 10-inch round. Cover with another sheet of parchment, wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill while the dough rises.
Step 4
Make the syrup: In a small pot over low heat, combine the sugar, ½ cup/110 grams water, orange zest, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom and cloves. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool completely while the spices steep and infuse the syrup. Strain out the solids before use. At this point, the syrup can be refrigerated for up to 1 week.
Step 5
Generously butter the bottom and sides of the inside of a 12-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet. Ladle 2 tablespoons/40 grams cooled syrup onto the bottom of the pan and swirl.
Step 6
About 15 minutes before you’re ready to start rolling your dough, remove the butter round from the refrigerator. Transfer the dough from the refrigerator to a lightly floured work surface. Flour the top and use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12-inch round.
Step 7
Unwrap the butter round and center it on the dough round. Fold 2 sides of the dough, along with the butter over itself so the dough meets in the center of the butter layer. Using your fingers, tap down lightly on the folded edges, just enough to adhere the dough to the butter. Fold the remaining 2 sides so they meet in the center, sealing the butter like an envelope. Press down on the folded edges again to adhere. At this point, you should have what looks like an 8-inch-square dough package.
Step 8
Flour the work surface beneath the dough, and lightly flour the top of the dough. Roll the dough out into a 12-by-18-inch rectangle.
Step 9
Fold the top short side of the dough a third of the way down the length of the dough. Fold the bottom of the dough up and over the remaining two-thirds of the dough so the short sides meet. Using your fingers, tap the folded edge just enough so it adheres. This is the first fold.
Step 10
Turn the dough so that the short sides are parallel to you. Lightly flour the surface and top of the dough again. Roll the dough into a 12-by-18-inch rectangle. Fold the top short side of the dough one-third of the way down the length of the dough. Fold the bottom of the dough up and over the remaining two-thirds of the dough so the short sides meet. Using your fingers, tap the folded edge just enough so it adheres. This is the second fold. Return the folded dough, wrapped in a sheet of parchment, to chill in the refrigerator for 10 minutes if you find the butter is beginning to melt between steps.
Step 11
Turn the dough so that the short sides are parallel to you. Roll the dough out into a 14-inch square. Fold the edges on the top half of the dough over in such a way that the top 2 corners meet in the center of the dough, forming what looks like a triangle at the top. Fold the bottom in such a way that the 2 corners meet in the middle. You should have a square dough with a cross cutting through the center to the edges. Roll it into a 14-inch square.
Step 12
Lift and pull the corners in to round out the edges. Flip the dough so that the cross side is down. Pat the dough down to even out the round shape, you should have a roughly 12-inch circle at this point. Using your hand to support the bottom, transfer the dough cross-side down to the prepared skillet. Using the tip of a paring knife, poke holes, 1-inch apart, all around the dough. Ladle 2 tablespoons/40 grams of syrup over the top and spread across the surface of the dough using your fingers. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and allow to rest at room temperature until the surface springs back slightly when you press it with a finger, about 30 minutes.
Step 13
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Dimple the dough by pressing down all over the surface with your fingers. Bake until light golden brown, 45 minutes.
Step 14
Flip the kouign-amann onto a board or the underside of a baking sheet without a lip. Pour 2 tablespoons/40 grams syrup over the bottom of the skillet and slide the kouign-amann back into the pan, cross side up. Brush some syrup over the top, sprinkle with a pinch of fine salt and return to the oven. Bake until you can hear the butter bubbling at the edges and the surface is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let sit in the pan for 5 minutes. Run an offset spatula or a knife along the edges to release them. Set a baking rack in a baking sheet, and flip the kouign-amann onto it, brush with the remaining syrup, sprinkle the top with a pinch of fine salt, and allow to cool slightly. Slide to a serving platter with the cross side down.
Step 15
Serve the kouign-amann in wedges while still warm. Use an offset spatula or a knife along the bottom of the pastry to release and lift each wedge from the plate. The kouign-amann will last, wrapped, at room temperature, for 1 to 2 days, or frozen for up to 2 weeks. Toast slices in a 400-degree oven for a few minutes before serving.

Prepare the ajo blanco: Cut the bread into 3 pieces, transfer to a bowl and add enough water to soak the bread. Toss to coat, then let sit while you prepare the garlic.
Step 2
Add the garlic cloves to a small saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high, then drain. Repeat two more times, adding fresh water each time then draining after it comes to a boil.
Step 3
Add the garlic cloves to a blender, along with the olive oil, cashews, vinegar and a pinch of salt. Give the bread a gentle squeeze to remove excess water, then add the bread to the blender. Purée the mixture until very smooth, scraping the sides as needed, then season to taste with salt. It may not emulsify immediately, but be patient with your blender. If the mixture seems too thick, you can add a splash of water, if needed. (If you’ve got an immersion blender, you may want to employ it here for extra-silky results.) Set aside ajo blanco.
Step 4
Prepare the broccoli rabe: Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli rabe and cook just until bright green, then transfer to a colander to drain. Pat the broccoli rabe dry using a clean kitchen towel.
Step 5
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high. Working in three batches, add the broccoli rabe in a single layer, making sure not to crowd the pan. Cook, turning once, until charred on two sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove from the skillet and transfer to a platter. Repeat two more times, adding 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet before each new batch, plus more if needed.

In a small bowl, combine the orange and lime zest and juice with the shallot, jalapeño, cumin and ½ teaspoon salt; stir to combine. Roughly chop two-thirds of the cilantro and add it to the bowl; toss to combine, then set aside the citrus mixture.
Step 2
Pat the shrimp dry. Season all over with salt and the paprika. Heat a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Add the oil, tilt the skillet to slick the bottom evenly, then spread the shrimp in an even layer. (It’s OK if they are a little snug.) Cook the shrimp, undisturbed, for 3 minutes, until just pink underneath. Turn the shrimp over and cook until the shrimp are fully pink all over, with no grey spots, 1 to 3 minutes more, depending on the size of the shrimp.
Step 3
Remove from the heat onto an empty burner and immediately pour the citrus mixture into the skillet, gently tossing to coat the shrimp, about 1 minute. (The shrimp will continue to cook in the residual heat so you can undercook the shrimp by 30 seconds.) Lightly tear or chop the remaining cilantro, sprinkle on top and serve.
To maximize the amount of citrus juice without using (or cleaning) a press, insert a fork into an orange or lime half, and move it up and down like a lever while squeezing the citrus. Pulp is welcome.

Make the meatballs: Add all the ingredients minus the oil to a medium bowl and use your hands to knead the mixture thoroughly. Use lightly oiled hands to roll into 18 small balls and place on a plate.
Step 2
Heat the 1 tablespoon of oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high. Once very hot, add the meatballs and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, turning as necessary, until nicely browned but not cooked through. Transfer the meatballs and any juices collected to a large, shallow bowl and set aside until needed.
Step 3
Make the broth: Add the onion, garlic and jalapeños to a food processor and blitz into a rough paste. Add the oil to a deep, medium lidded saucepan and place it over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion mixture and cook for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned. Add the tomato paste, cilantro, cumin, coriander and turmeric and cook for 1½ to 2 minutes, stirring often, until deeply red. Add the collard greens in big handfuls, stirring with each addition, until slightly wilted. Stir in the semolina and sugar, then the stock, 1 cup water, 1½ teaspoons salt and a good grind of pepper; bring to a boil over high. Turn the heat down to medium and leave to simmer for 15 minutes.
Step 4
While the broth simmers, make the dumplings: In a large bowl, whisk the buttermilk, butter, egg, baking powder, ½ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper just until combined. Add the bread crumbs and semolina and mix until just combined; don’t overwork it. Set aside for 5 minutes to firm up slightly, then use your hands to shape the mixture into 18 small balls. Make sure they’re nice and compact as you shape them.
Step 5
Turn the heat on the broth down to medium-low and stir in the meatballs. Next, gently lower in the dumplings one by one, without stirring. Cover the pot and leave to cook for 10 minutes, until the dumplings have puffed up and are cooked through. Remove the lid and gently stir in the lemon juice.
Step 6
Divide the soup among 4 bowls then drizzle with the extra buttermilk, sprinkle with additional cilantro and serve warm.
To make fresh bread crumbs, slice the crusts off standard white sandwich bread. Cut the crustless bread into pieces, then blitz in a food processor into fine crumbs.

Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)","539 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. To butterfly the chicken, place the chicken on a cutting board, breast-side down. Using sharp kitchen shears, remove the backbone by cutting on either side of the backbone. (Freeze the backbone for stock.) Flip the chicken, setting it breast-side up, and flatten by pressing firmly in the center; you should hear a crack.
Step 2
Pat chicken dry. Season the chicken on both sides with salt, about ½ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt per pound of chicken. (If time allows, refrigerate the chicken, uncovered, for up to 24 hours, which will lead to crisper skin and juicier meat.)
Step 3
Using scissors or a knife, cut the tough ends off the greens, then cut in half crosswise. Transfer to a sheet pan along with 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, the red-pepper flakes, and a generous sprinkling of salt. Toss and squeeze the greens until coated in oil. Spread out on the sheet pan, pour over ½ cup water, place the garlic cloves in the center of the greens, then place the chicken on top of the garlic. Rub the remaining tablespoon oil onto the chicken skin.
Step 4
Roast until the chicken is browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to rest at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, stir the greens to scrape up any browned bits from the pan. Carve the chicken and pour any resting juices over the greens. Serve chicken with the greens and a squeeze of lemon if desired.

packed cup fresh mint leaves and tender stems, roughly chopped
1
Persian cucumber, diced into ½-inch pieces (about ¾ cup)
2
scallions, light green and white parts sliced","3554 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In the center of a sheet pan, place salmon skin-side down. Pat the salmon dry, then coat with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, ½ teaspoon cumin and ½ teaspoon turmeric. Coat 1 of the lime halves in some of the olive oil in the pan, then place cut-side up in the corner.
Step 2
Roast the salmon on the center rack until opaque on the outside and light pink in the center, about 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.
Step 3
While the salmon roasts, make the couscous: In a lidded pot over medium-high heat, toast the couscous, uncovered, stirring until fragrant, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add 3 cups water, season with salt, cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to maintain an active simmer, then cook until the couscous is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the couscous in a colander, then drizzle with olive oil, tossing to coat. Stir in the arugula, letting it wilt. Leave in the sink to cool slightly while you make the dressing.
Step 4
Prepare the dressing: In a serving bowl, combine the yogurt with ¼ cup room temperature water and the zest and juice of 1 lime, then whisk until smooth. Add the remaining ½ teaspoon cumin, plus ¼ cup feta, most of the herbs (reserving some for garnish) and the cucumber. Stir to combine, then season to taste with salt. Set aside.
Step 5
Add the cooked couscous and arugula to the yogurt mixture, tossing to combine. Remove the salmon from the skin, then flake with a fork. Add half the salmon to the couscous, mixing it together. Place the remaining salmon on top, squeeze the roasted lime half over the dish, then garnish with the scallions, remaining feta, parsley and mint. Quarter the remaining lime half and serve it on the side.

Crushed pitted green olives, sliced pickled pepperoncini peppers, crumbled feta and/or lemon wedges, for serving","226 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, stir together 1¾ cups water with the rice, lima beans, half the dill, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover tightly with a lid, sheet pan or foil, reduce heat to low and cook until rice is tender, about 17 minutes.
Step 2
Uncover and stir with a fork. (If using a lima bean alternative, stir it into the rice now.) Spread the rice in an even layer, then make four divots. (You’ll add your eggs to them in Step 3.) Now crisp the rice: Pour the oil down the sides of the pan and into the divots, increase heat to medium and cook until the rice is golden brown at the edges, 2 to 5 minutes. If you don’t see oil bubbling at the edges, drizzle in a little more oil.
Step 3
Crack the eggs into the divots, cover the pan and cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny, 2 to 4 minutes. Season the eggs with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining ¼ cup dill and, if using, olives, peppers, feta and/or a squeeze of lemon.
Instead of frozen lima beans, use the same amount of frozen, shelled edamame (no need to thaw); cooked, drained beans (homemade or one 15-ounce can); or chopped vegetables that cook in about 5 minutes, like spinach, green beans or celery. For any of these options, stir them into the rice at the start of Step 2.

Scallions (optional), for serving

Cooked white rice (optional), for serving","68 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Sprinkle chicken thighs with 1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning, the paprika, granulated garlic, granulated onion, ½ teaspoon black pepper and 1 teaspoon olive oil. Massage chicken with all the seasonings then let sit until room temperature, about 20 minutes.
Step 2
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium until hot, about 5 minutes. Place the chicken thighs into the hot oil and cover. Cook until brown on one side, about 5 minutes, then flip the chicken, cover and cook until brown on the other side, another 5 minutes. (Covering the chicken helps keep it juicy.) Remove the thighs and set aside, leaving the fat and juices in the pan.

cups/215 grams black sesame seeds
1
teaspoon kosher salt

Cooking spray, as needed
¾
cup/150 grams granulated sugar
2
tablespoons light corn syrup","38 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread sesame seeds onto a large baking tray and toast in oven until the seeds are fragrant, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool on the tray. Mix in the salt.
Step 2
Spray two sheets of parchment paper with cooking spray and prepare a clean work space.
Step 3
Bring sugar, corn syrup and ¼ cup water to a boil in a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer. Once the mixture comes to a boil and the sugar has dissolved, lower the heat to medium and continue cooking, without stirring, until the mixture reaches 250 degrees on the candy thermometer, 3 to 4 minutes.
Step 4
Turn off the heat and stir in the sesame seeds and fold until they’re coated with syrup. Turn the sesame mixture onto one sheet of oiled parchment and place the other sheet of parchment on top, oiled side down. With a rolling pin, quickly roll the sesame mixture until about ¼-inch thick.
Step 5
Transfer the rolled sesame onto a cutting board and peel off the two sheets of parchment. While the mixture is still warm, using a kitchen knife, quickly cut it into 1-inch wide strips. Turn the strips and cut into roughly 1½-inch-long pieces. (Do not worry if the pieces are not even, they will be just as good.) Let cool and serve. Store the candy in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.

cup/60 milliliters fresh lime juice (from about 2 medium limes), plus more as needed
½
cup/64 grams unsalted roasted shelled pistachios, sliced or coarsely chopped

Flaky sea salt, for garnish","780 user ratings","1 hour 35 minutes, plus cooling and setting","Step 1
Prepare the cake: Heat oven to 350 degrees and coat a 12-cup (or larger) Bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, pistachio pudding mix and baking powder. In a second medium bowl whisk together the milk, yogurt and vanilla bean paste until smooth.
Step 3
Combine the egg whites and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or in a large mixing bowl if using a hand mixer). Beat on medium speed until frothy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sugar, increase the mixer speed to high, and beat until the egg whites are marshmallowy with firm peaks that form when the beater is lifted, 4 to 5 minutes.
Step 4
Remove the bowl from the stand mixer, add the flour mixture and canola oil, and gently mix them into the egg whites using a rubber spatula until smooth and no pockets of unincorporated flour remain. Gently mix in the milk mixture until completely smooth, and then stir in the pistachios until evenly distributed throughout the batter.
Step 5
Pour the batter evenly into the prepared Bundt pan, smooth into an even layer and tap the pan on the counter several times to remove any large air pockets. Bake until the top of the cake is lightly browned and a skewer or cake tester inserted into the center comes out with just a few moist crumbs attached, 60 to 75 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, then flip the cake out onto a wire rack and let cool completely before glazing.
Step 6
While the cake is cooling, make the whipped ricotta: Transfer the ricotta to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment and add the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla paste, olive oil and salt. Process until the mixture is completely smooth, stopping and scraping down the sides of the food processor as needed, 40 to 60 seconds total. (Alternatively, set a fine mesh strainer over a large mixing bowl and add the ricotta to the strainer. Use a rubber spatula to press the ricotta through the strainer into the bowl. Add the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla paste, olive oil and salt to the bowl of ricotta and vigorously whisk until smooth.) Transfer to a bowl, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. Makes about 1⅔ cups.
Step 7
Once the cake is completely cooled, make the glaze: In a large mixing bowl whisk together the confectioners’ sugar and lime juice until the sugar is completely dissolved. The glaze should be very thick yet pourable. If the glaze is too thin, whisk in additional powdered sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. If it’s too thick, whisk in additional lime juice 1 teaspoon at a time. Transfer the glaze into a piping big or large zip-top bag with the corner cut off and drizzle the glaze over the top of the cooled cake, allowing it to drip down the sides. Immediately garnish the top with the sliced pistachios and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Let stand until the glaze has set, about 20 minutes, and serve with the whipped ricotta.
Whipped ricotta can be made up to a week in advance and stored in the fridge tightly covered with plastic wrap.

8
ounces ground pork
2
scallions, finely chopped

teaspoons Shaoxing wine or dry sherry
2
teaspoons soy sauce, preferably light (see Tip)
1
teaspoon sesame oil
1
teaspoon granulated sugar
⅛
teaspoon ground white or black pepper
50 to 60
wonton wrappers, preferably thin egg-based Hong Kong-style wrappers (see Tip)","122 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Coarsely chop the shrimp into ½-inch pieces, then toss with ½ teaspoon salt in a colander until evenly coated. Let stand while preparing the remaining filling ingredients. This will both flavor the shrimp and draw out the excess moisture so that they end up snappy in the cooked wontons.
Step 2
Using a ginger grater or Microplane, finely grate 2 teaspoons ginger into a large bowl. Using your fingers, press the grated ginger to squeeze out 1 teaspoon ginger juice; discard the solids. Stir in the pork, scallions, cornstarch, oyster sauce, wine, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, pepper and 1 teaspoon salt until evenly mixed. Using a paper towel, pat the shrimp very dry. Add to the pork and stir until evenly distributed.
Step 3
Set up an assembly line for forming wontons by placing the bowl of filling next to the wrappers and a small dish of water and lining a sheet pan with parchment for the wrapped wontons. If a wrapper tears over the filling during assembly, it can be discarded.
Step 4
To shape wontons for wonton soup: Place a heaping spoonful of filling near one corner of a wrapper. You want to try to get as much filling in there as possible, about a tablespoon, but you can start with a smaller amount for easier folding. Using your fingertip, wet the wrapper corner nearest the filling, then fold that corner over the filling to enclose it, pleating the wrapper around the filling and pressing that corner just past the center of the remaining wrapper. You should end up with a bump of enclosed filling and a pleated tail of wrapper. Place on the prepared pan and repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
Step 5
To shape wontons for deep-frying, place a heaping teaspoon of filling in the center of the wrapper. Using your fingertip, wet the borders of the wrapper, then fold it in half to form a rectangle or a triangle, encasing the filling and making sure there are no air pockets around it. Take two corners on the long side and bring them together to meet in the center over the filling, using water if needed to make the corners stick and hold. Place on the prepared pan and repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
Step 6
Once you’ve filled all of the wontons, you can prepare as many as you’d like immediately, boiling them for soup or deep-frying for a snack. The rest can be frozen uncovered on the sheet tray until solid, about 2 hours. Transfer them to an airtight container and freeze for up to 2 months. Cook straight from the freezer, adding a few minutes of cooking time.
Chinese light soy sauce isn’t the same as low- or less-sodium soy sauce. It’s lighter in color and also saltier. If using regular soy sauce, increase the amount to 1 tablespoon (and expect a slightly darker filling).
Hong Kong-style wonton wrappers are distinguished by their small square shape, thinness and the addition of eggs to a flour-based dough. They’re sold in the refrigerated section of Chinese and other markets, and those options work great. If they’re not available nearby, they can be made at home with basic pantry ingredients using this recipe for Wonton Wrappers.

½
cup/114 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
1
teaspoon pure vanilla extract
2
tablespoons white sesame seeds, for sprinkling","382 user ratings","45 minutes, plus chilling and cooling","Step 1
In a food processor, process the black sesame seeds, sugar and salt until the mixture forms a mass around the blade, about 3 minutes. The fat from the seeds should release, and the blend should go from the texture of wet sand to on the verge of becoming pasty. Scrape the bowl and add the flour. Pulse until the flour is evenly incorporated with the seeds into a sandy mixture.
Step 2
Add the butter and vanilla, and pulse until the mixture forms a mass around the blade. Transfer to a sheet of plastic wrap and firmly squeeze, and roll into a 2-inch-diameter log. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1½ hours or up to 3 days.
Step 3
When ready to bake, heat the oven to 350 degrees with racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Step 4
Cut the chilled log into ⅓-inch-thick slices and place on the prepared sheets, spacing ½ inch apart. If any bits of dough crumble off while slicing, pat them back into the rounds. Sprinkle the tops with the white sesame seeds.
Step 5
Bake, switching the positions of the sheets halfway through, until the edges are brown and the tops golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool completely on the sheets on wire racks. The shortbread will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
Black sesame seeds, particularly ones from Japanese brands, are often sold toasted. If you can find only raw black sesame seeds, toast them by stirring them in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant and popping, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool completely before grinding. Taste the black sesame seeds before baking to make sure they’re not rancid; they should be nutty and delicious.

cups cold water, preferably filtered
3
very tightly packed cups/28 grams shaved katsuobushi (also called hana-katsuo; smoked and dried bonito flakes)","50 user ratings","35 minutes, plus at least 30 minutes soaking","Step 1
Combine the kombu with the cold water in a donabe or Dutch oven and let soak for at least 20 minutes. (If time permits, soaking for 2 to 3 hours or up to overnight is even better. In this case, use a separate bowl for soaking, then transfer the contents to the donabe when they are ready.) When the kombu is soft, cut some slits in it with scissors so the kombu will release more flavor.
Step 2
Set the donabe over medium-low heat and slowly bring the liquid with the kombu to a low simmer, about 30 minutes. Remove the kombu (see Tip).
Step 3
Increase the heat to medium and bring the liquid to a high simmer, about 5 minutes, then immediately turn off the heat. Add the katsuobushi all at once, then let it settle under the surface of the liquid, about 2 minutes. Gently strain the dashi through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. (Resist the temptation to press the katsuobushi to extract more flavor, or you’ll end up with a dashi that tastes more overtly fishy than oceanic.) Dashi keeps, refrigerated, for a few days.
If you like, you can even preserve the kombu by simmering it in soy sauce, mirin and sugar to create a sweet kombu garnish for Shalom Japan’s Lox Bowl.

3 to 4
tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)
1
to 1½ cups toasted walnuts, roughly chopped

Handful of chopped chives (optional)","2131 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Heat a large Dutch oven or pot over medium. Add the olive oil and butter. When the butter has melted, add cumin seeds and bloom for 15 seconds, then add the leeks, garlic, cabbage and 2 teaspoons salt, and stir for 3 to 4 minutes until wilted. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 10 minutes without stirring. Check every few minutes to make sure the bottom is not burning. If needed, give it a stir.
Step 2
After 10 minutes, remove the lid from the cabbage and stir. Cover and cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, until it is supersweet and tender. Taste and season with kosher salt.
Step 3
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions. When the pasta is ready, do not drain, but use tongs to drag the pasta out of its cooking water and straight into the pot with the cabbage. Add about 1 cup of pasta cooking water, along with the pecorino and the black pepper. Toss well to combine.
Step 4
Add lemon juice. Taste, adjusting seasonings with more salt, pepper or lemon, if needed. To serve, scatter with walnuts and finish with more pecorino and chopped chives, if using.

"Wonton Soup","Chinese,Dumplings,Bok Choy,Lunar New Year,Noodle,Scallion,Soup,Dinner,Easy,Lunch,Quick,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","
Salt
2
quarts chicken stock, preferably homemade (see Tip)
12
baby bok choy, cut in halves or quarters lengthwise
8
ounces fresh wonton noodles (optional)
20
fresh or unthawed frozen wontons
1
scallion, thinly sliced

Soy sauce, red vinegar, chile oil or chile crisp, for serving","395 user ratings","10 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In another large saucepan, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Add the bok choy to the stock, immersing all of it, then immediately turn the heat to the lowest setting. Let stand until ready to serve, 5 to 10 minutes. Season broth with salt, to taste.
Step 2
If serving with noodles, cook the noodles in the boiling water according to the package’s directions. Transfer to serving bowls with tongs or chopsticks, and bring the water back to a boil. Drop the wontons into the boiling water and gently stir to make sure they don’t stick to one another or to the bottom of the pot. When the water returns to a rapid boil, add 2 cups cold water, then adjust the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Once the wontons float on the surface, continue to simmer for 2 minutes. The dough should look slightly translucent.
Step 3
Using a spider or slotted spoon, divide the wontons among the serving bowls, then divide the bok choy and broth among the bowls. Serve immediately with scallion and soy sauce, vinegar, chile oil or chile crisp.
To make homemade chicken stock for wonton soup, combine 8 ounces chicken wings, 8 ounces ground pork, 3 slices of ginger, 2 cut-up scallions and 7 cups water in a large pot. (Add an ounce of dried Chinese mushrooms or dried scallops and a whole star anise, if you have them.) Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally, then immediately turn down the heat to maintain a bare simmer. Simmer, skimming any foam on top, for 35 minutes. Strain, discard the solids and season the stock to taste. For a quick shortcut to more flavorful soup, simmer 5 cups store-bought chicken stock with 2 ginger slices and 2 cut-up scallions for 15 minutes.

"Wonton Wrappers","Chinese,Project,All Purpose Flour,Dough,Egg,Lunar New Year,Make Ahead,Vegetarian","Yield: About 58 (3-inch) wrappers","2
cups/260 grams all-purpose flour
½
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
2
large eggs, at room temperature
2
tablespoons warm water

Cornstarch, for dusting","46 user ratings","1 hour, plus 1 hour’s resting","Step 1
Mix the flour and salt on a clean work surface or in a large bowl using chopsticks or a fork. Mound the mixture, then form a well in the center. Break the eggs into the well and beat lightly until swirled yellow. Add the water and beat to incorporate, then gradually draw in the flour from the edges of the well while mixing gently.
Step 2
Once all of the flour has been mixed with the wet ingredients, gather the shaggy dough and stray dry bits with your hands and knead together. Continue kneading until smooth, evenly yellow and slightly elastic, 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should hold together but not be sticky. Divide the dough evenly in half and pat each half into a rectangle.
Step 3
Loosely wrap each piece of dough in plastic wrap and let stand for 1 hour at room temperature. This will help the dough relax and make it easier to roll.
Step 4
If you have a pasta roller, press one piece of dough flat, then pass it through each setting of the roller twice, from the widest to the narrowest setting to create a rectangle 5 to 6 inches wide and 39 to 40 inches long. If you don’t have a pasta roller, flatten a piece of dough and roll with a pin on a clean, unfloured surface. In both cases, the dough shouldn’t be at all sticky, but if it is, very lightly dust it with cornstarch. If the dough keeps springing back, let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes before rolling again and very gently stretch it with your hands as well. You want it to be as thin as possible without tearing.
Step 5
Using a ruler and pizza wheel or sharp knife, cut the rectangle into 26 to 30 (3-inch) squares by cutting it in half lengthwise, then crosswise into 13 to 15 even pieces. Very lightly dust the wrappers with cornstarch, then stack and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Repeat with the other piece of dough. The wrappers are best if used right away to form wontons, but they can be stored wrapped in plastic wrap, then stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to 2 days.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the condensed milk and water on low speed until blended, then increase the speed to medium and whisk until well combined, about 1 minute. Add the instant pudding mix and beat until there are no lumps and the mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl, cover and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.
Step 2
Using the stand mixer with the whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream on medium speed for about 1 minute, until the cream starts to thicken, then increase the speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overwhip.
Step 3
With the mixer running on low speed, add the pudding mixture a spoonful at a time. Mix until well blended and no streaks of pudding remain.
Step 4
To assemble, set aside 4 to 5 cookies, whole or crumbled, for garnish. In a 4- to 5-quart trifle bowl or a wide glass bowl (or in 12 8-ounce bowls or ramekins), spread one-quarter of the pudding over the bottom and layer with one-third of the cookies and one-third of the sliced bananas (enough to cover the layer). Repeat the layering twice more. End with a final layer of pudding.
Step 5
Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours. Cookies should be tender when poked with a knife. This dessert is best served within 12 hours of assembling. To serve, garnish the top with the reserved cookies or cookie crumbs.

"Slow-Cooker Beans","Beans,Bean,Olive Oil,Salt,Slow Cooker,Vegan,Vegetarian","Yield: About 6 cups","1
pound dried beans (except red kidney beans; see Tip)
¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)

Optional flavorings (see Tip 1)","521 user ratings","10 hours","Step 1
In a 5-quart or larger slow cooker, add the beans, olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and your selection of flavorings. Add water to cover 2 inches above the beans, then cook on low until tender, 8 to 10 hours. (See Tip 2.) To test for doneness, taste more than one bean to ensure they’re all cooked through; they should flatten without much effort when pressed between your fingers. (If you plan to eat your beans cold, cook them a bit past tender, as they’ll firm as they cool.) Season to taste with salt.
Step 2
Let cool slightly, then eat right away or store beans in their liquid in an airtight container for up to a week in the fridge or up to 3 months in the freezer.
Fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, celery, fennel, shallots, scallions, leeks, onion, garlic or lemon peel work well. Spices and herbs, such as dried or fresh rosemary, parsley, basil, thyme, sage, oregano, bay leaves, or ground or whole spices work well. For heat, add red-pepper flakes, chipotle chile in adobo, fresh jalapeño or serrano chile, dried chiles or whole peppercorns. For umami, add bacon, pancetta, ham hock, dried mushrooms, Parmesan rinds, kombu or dashi.
All dried beans should reach a simmer and cook until tender to be safe to eat. If your slow cooker does not reach a simmer on the low setting, increase the heat level to high, and ensure the beans cook at a simmer for at least 15 minutes at some point in the cooking process.

In a large bowl, cover the beans with plenty of water and soak for 8 to 12 hours.
Step 2
When ready to cook, in a large Dutch oven or pot, add the bacon, set over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden and crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to a plate or bowl, leaving the fat in the pot.
Step 3
Add the onions, garlic, peppers and cilantro stems to the bacon fat and cook until softened and browned in spots, 10 to 12 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the beans to the pot. Pour in enough of the bean’s soaking liquid to cover the beans by 1 inch; if you run out of soaking liquid, use fresh water. Season generously with salt. Bring to a boil over high, then reduce heat to simmer until beans are tender but not yet soft or falling apart, 1 to 1½ hours. Check the beans periodically and if the water level is below the beans, add soaking liquid or, if you’re out, fresh water to cover.
Step 4
Taste the bean liquid and if it tastes dull or murky, add salt. Pour in the beer and gently simmer until liquid has thickened slightly and the beans are soft and creamy, 30 to 40 minutes. Taste more than one bean to ensure they’re all cooked through; they should flatten without much effort when pressed between your fingers. Stir in the reserved bacon, then season to taste with salt. Eat with the reserved cilantro leaves. Beans will keep for up to 5 days refrigerated.

In a large (12-inch) skillet with a lid or a large Dutch oven, bring 1 inch of water to a boil over high. Carefully add the eggs. (They may not be fully submerged and that’s OK.) Cover and boil for 6 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl to cool. Pour off all but ¼ inch of water.
Step 2
While the eggs steam, in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the yogurt, lemon zest and juice, ginger and sesame oil; season with salt. It might taste too puckery at this point, but it will balance out when on the vegetables.

Arrange the squash in a single layer in the shallow water; season with salt. Cover, bring to a boil over high, and cook for 5 minutes. Scatter the broccoli on top of the squash, season with salt, then pile the kale on top of the broccoli and season with salt. If the water has evaporated, add another ¼ inch of water. Cover and cook until the squash is tender and the broccoli is bright green and crisp-tender, 2 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat but keep the skillet covered while you peel the eggs.

When the squash is cool enough to handle, add it to the kale mixture. Drizzle with most of the dressing. Toss until coated, adding more dressing as needed. Taste and adjust seasonings with more salt and pepper. (To make ahead, refrigerate the dressing and salad separately for up to 3 days.

"Garlic Chicken With Giardiniera Sauce","Poultry,Chicken Breast,Chicken Thigh,Fresh Herb,Garlic,Dinner,Easy,Quick,Weeknight,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","1
cup soft herb leaves, coarsely chopped (see Tip)
¾
cup mild or hot giardiniera, coarsely chopped if necessary
3
tablespoons giardiniera brine
¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
2
garlic cloves, finely grated

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)

Black pepper
1½ to 2
pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, patted dry","198 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
In a medium bowl, stir together the herbs, giardiniera and giardiniera brine. (It might look dry but it gets saucier as it sits.) In a large bowl, stir together the olive oil, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper. If you’re using chicken breasts, pound to an even ½-inch thickness with a heavy skillet or meat pounder. Add the chicken to the garlic oil and toss until well coated.
Step 2
Heat a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high. Working in batches to avoid crowding, add the chicken to the skillet and cook until golden brown underneath, 4 to 5 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, 2 to 5 minutes. (Clean the skillet between batches if burnt bits collect in the skillet.) Transfer to a plate browned-side up, spoon some of the sauce over the chicken, then let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 3
Taste the sauce. If it’s too assertive, add a teaspoon or two of olive oil. If it’s too mild, add salt. Serve the chicken with more sauce passed at the table.
If using parsley, cilantro or dill, thinly slice the stems as well; they’re edible, concentrated bursts of the herbs. Tear any large basil leaves, and slice chives into 1-inch or so lengths.

cup freshly squeezed lemon juice, plus more to taste
1
tablespoon finely grated lemon zest
4 to 5
ounces baby or wild arugula, coarsely chopped, or use baby kale or spinach (4 to 5 cups)

Grated Parmesan, for serving","1972 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until it is 1 minute shy of being al dente, usually a minute or 2 less than the package instructions. Scoop out about 1½ cups pasta water, then drain pasta.
Step 2
While the pasta cooks, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the foam subsides, the milk solids turn golden-brown and the butter smells nutty and toasty, 3 to 4 minutes. (Watch carefully to see that it doesn’t burn.)
Step 3
Stir in almonds, rosemary and red-pepper flakes, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are toasted and slightly darker in color, about 1 minute.
Step 4
Add about 1 cup pasta water to the skillet and bring to a simmer. Add lemon juice, zest, ½ teaspoon salt and a large pinch of black pepper, then add drained pasta and toss well. Add arugula, tossing until it wilts. Simmer for another minute, if needed, to thicken the sauce until it’s thick and glossy. If the mixture seems dry, add more pasta water 1 tablespoon at a time.
Step 5
Taste and add more salt, red-pepper flakes and lemon juice, if needed. Serve topped with grated Parmesan and more red-pepper flakes, if you like.

whole (4-pound) chicken (back and neck reserved, if available)
2
tablespoons neutral oil
1
teaspoon ground turmeric
1
teaspoon ground hot paprika
½
teaspoon annatto seeds (optional)
1
medium yellow onion, finely diced
8
garlic cloves, peeled
1
fresh or dried bay leaf

Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper
⅓
cup white rice, rinsed
1
medium yuca (about 1 ½ pounds)
1
medium butternut squash (1 ½ to 2 ½ pounds)
2
green (unripe) plantains (about 6 ounces each)
1
tablespoon dried oregano
6
eggs (optional)
⅓
cup roughly chopped parsley leaves and tender stems","96 user ratings","1¾ hours","Step 1
Cut the chicken into 10 parts: Place the chicken on a cutting board, breast side up. With a sharp knife, remove the wings and legs at the joint. Split each leg at the joint into the thigh and drumstick; set aside. Hold the whole chicken with the largest cavity pointing up and locate the ribcage running along the side. Firmly cut down the opening to separate the breast from the back. Lay the breast skin side down and cut the breast in half down the middle lengthwise, then again in half crosswise to yield 4 bone-in pieces of breast; set aside.
Step 2
In a large pot (at least 6 quarts) over medium-low heat, add the neutral oil, turmeric, paprika and annatto seeds (if using). Cook until oil is stained red and spices are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the onion, garlic and bay leaf, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 3
Add the chicken pieces, including the back and neck, toss to coat, and season with 4 teaspoons kosher salt. Add the rice and 12 cups of water. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a gentle simmer. Once simmering, turn the heat down to medium and gently simmer for 1 hour, skimming the foam from the top as needed.
Step 4
While the broth simmers, prepare the yuca: Fill a medium pot with water. Peel yuca, then cut crosswise into 3-inch segments. Position the yuca upright on one flat side, then cut in half. Place the yuca in the medium pot. Season with salt and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until yuca is tender, about 45 minutes. Drain the yuca, pull off any tough strings running down the middle, and set aside until soup is ready.
Step 5
Meanwhile, trim the top and bottom of the squash, then remove the skin using a peeler. Place the squash cut side down for stability, then cut in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scoop all of the seeds out and store in the fridge for another use. Cut the squash crosswise into 1- to 1 ½-inch wedges. (There is no need to be overly precise here, the squash will break down into smaller pieces as it cooks.)
Step 6
Once the yuca has cooked, trim the tops and bottoms of the green plantains; cut each in half crosswise, then quarter each piece lengthwise. Pry the skins off; set plantains aside.
Step 7
When the broth is ready, remove and discard the chicken back and neck. Add the squash and green plantains and simmer until tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Add cooked yuca to the pot. If it seems like soup is too dry, add water as needed and bring back to a simmer. Stir in the oregano, then season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 8
If using eggs, crack the eggs directly into the soup, making sure the eggs don’t overlap, and cover with a lid. Cook until egg whites are fully set, about 3 minutes. Finish soup with parsley and serve immediately.

cup low-sodium chicken stock
⅓
cup sour cream

Salt and black pepper

Hot sauce, for serving
2
tablespoons thinly sliced scallions","191 user ratings","30 minutes to 1½ hours, depending on your grits","Step 1
Prepare the grits: Bring 2 cups water, the milk, butter and ½ teaspoon salt to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Once the mixture is boiling, whisk in the grits in a slow and steady stream. Reduce the heat to low so that the grits are simmering, with small bubbles just breaking the surface.
Step 2
Cook the grits over low heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened and creamy, and the grits have popped open and smell like popcorn, at least 20 minutes, or over 1 hour, depending on the variety and coarseness of the grits. When stirring, be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the pot to prevent the grits from sticking and burning. If the grits thicken before they are completely cooked, add more water, a couple tablespoons at a time, and continue cooking until done.
Step 3
While the grits are cooking, prepare the shrimp: Pat the shrimp dry, then toss them in a medium bowl with the Creole seasoning; set aside.
Step 4
Add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced sausage and cook, stirring frequently, until the fat has rendered and the sausage is crispy along the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Working in batches, add the shrimp and cook about 1 ½ minutes each side, until cooked through. Transfer the shrimp to the plate with the sausage.
Step 5
Add the diced onion and bell pepper to the skillet, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for an additional minute.
Step 6
Add the stewed tomatoes and stock, and increase the heat to high. Once the liquid is boiling, reduce the heat to medium and simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 7
Add shrimp and sausage and cook until hot, about 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and swirl in the sour cream. Taste to adjust seasoning, adding salt or pepper as needed.
Step 8
When the grits are done, remove from the heat and stir in the pepper and cheese, if using. Taste to adjust seasoning, adding up to an additional ½ teaspoon more salt if desired. Serve immediately, topped with the hot shrimp mixture. Finish with a few dashes of hot sauce and a sprinkling of scallions.
For a more savory profile, prepare the grits in 4 cups of low-sodium chicken stock instead of water and milk.
If you don’t have Creole seasoning, you can combine 1¼ teaspoons smoked paprika, ¾ teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne.

Arrange racks in the middle and bottom of the oven, and heat the oven to 425 degrees. You will need 2 sheet pans. Line one with parchment paper.
Step 2
Prepare the tofu: Cut each block of tofu crosswise into ½-inch slices and pat them dry with a kitchen towel.
Step 3
In a large baking dish or rimmed plate, drizzle 3 to 4 tablespoons of oil. In another large baking dish or rimmed plate, scatter the cornstarch, season it with 1 teaspoon of salt and a few pinches of black pepper, and toss to combine.
Step 4
Place each slice of tofu in the oil and coat both sides, then dip the tofu into the cornstarch and lightly coat both sides. Place the coated tofu straight onto the lined sheet pan. Continue until all the tofu has been coated. All of the tofu should fit on one sheet pan.

tablespoon unsalted butter
4 to 8
slices of bread, toasted, for serving (optional)","185 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the mushrooms: Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over medium high. Add the olive oil, then throw in all the mushrooms and cook for 10 to 12 minutes, stirring or shaking the pan every few minutes, until the mushrooms are golden.
Step 2
While the mushrooms are cooking, place the miso paste, butter and garlic into a small bowl and, using the back of a fork, mash everything together.
Step 3
When the mushrooms are ready, add the miso butter and toss for about 2 minutes, allowing the butter to melt and the miso to coat all of the mushrooms and become slightly sticky. Add the sesame seeds and toss to distribute evenly. Remove from heat and transfer the mushrooms to a plate.
Step 4
Rinse out the skillet with water and dry it. Place it over medium-high heat.
Step 5
Prepare the eggs: Break the eggs into a medium bowl and season with 1 teaspoon of salt and a few turns of black pepper. Whisk well until the whites and yolk are completely combined.
Step 6
Cook the eggs in two batches: To the hot pan, add half of the butter and allow it to melt, swirling it around the pan. Pour in roughly half the eggs and cook undisturbed for 10 to 15 seconds to allow the bottom to set then, using a flexible spatula, push the eggs around the perimeter of the pan in a circular motion, allowing the runnier parts of the egg to cook. Continue to push the eggs in a circular motion for 5 to 10 seconds, just until the center is slightly wet looking and the egg looks rippled. The whole process only takes about 20 to 30 seconds. Remove from the pan and continue with the remaining egg.

Serve the eggs with a mound of miso butter mushrooms, with toast on the side, if you like.

¾
cup granulated sugar
¼
gram saffron, ground (⅛ teaspoon)
1½
teaspoons ground cardamom
½
cup shelled pistachios, toasted and chopped","81 user ratings","4½ hours","Step 1
Soak the rice: In a large bowl, wash the rice, massaging gently to release the starch without breaking the grains. Drain and repeat 2 times, then soak the rice in enough water to cover (to allow for the grains to expand) for around 2 hours.
Step 2
Meanwhile, cook the lamb: Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high. Season the lamb generously with salt and add to the hot oil. Cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 10 minutes. Move the lamb to one side of the pan and add the onion to the other side. Season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir to incorporate the lamb, scraping up any browned bits. Add enough water to come halfway up the lamb pieces (about 1 cup), bring to a boil, then cover. Simmer over low heat until tender, 1 to 1½ hours, turning the pieces once or twice and adding 1 to 2 tablespoons water if the pot threatens to dry out.
Step 3
While the lamb simmers, prepare the orange peels: Thoroughly wash and dry the oranges, then peel them with a vegetable peeler, taking as little of the white pith as possible. Finely slice the peels into very thin strips. You should have 1 cup.
Step 4
Put the strips in a pot with enough water to cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Let boil for 15 minutes. Drain the water, retaining the peels, then refill with water. Repeat the boiling process two more times. After being boiled three times, the peels will have lost most of their bitterness.
Step 5
After the third boil, drain the water and add the sugar, saffron, ½ teaspoon cardamom and ¼ cup water to the pot. Cook over medium heat until the sugar has formed a syrup but before it begins to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Transfer the orange peels to a small plate or bowl, reserving the syrup.
Step 6
Bring an 8-quart, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice to the boiling water and cook, uncovered (the way you would cook pasta), until the grains have slightly softened, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander, then reserve 1 cup rice and add the remaining back to the original pot.
Step 7
Add 2 teaspoons salt and the remaining 1 teaspoon cardamom to the pot with the rice and gently stir to combine. Add the lamb mixture (including any liquid) and stir to combine. Mound the rice mixture in the middle of the pot away from the edges and poke holes in the rice with the handle of a wooden spoon for steam to escape. Lay a clean cloth or paper towel over the top of the pot, then put the lid on to hold the cloth in place. Cook on the lowest heat setting for 20 to 30 minutes. When the rice is done, the grains will be tender with a little chewiness at the center.
Step 8
While the rice and lamb are cooking, take the reserved cup of cooked rice and add to the smaller pot with ¼ cup of the orange syrup. Gently combine, then cover with a lid and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once simmering, turn the heat to low and cook until the liquid is fully absorbed and the rice is cooked through, 15 to 25 minutes.
Step 9
Scoop the rice-and-lamb mixture onto a large platter and shape it into a low mound. Take the rice cooked in orange syrup and spread it generously over the top of the mound and down the sides. Spread the candied orange peel over the rice and adorn with the toasted pistachios.
Some markets sell lamb cut into chunks with its bones and you can use that here, but you also can ask the butcher to cut whole shanks into pieces.

Carefully pour hot oil through sieve directly onto the red-pepper flakes, which will sizzle and fry in the hot oil. Discard strained spices. (You should have a little more than 1 cup oil.) Allow mixture to cool at least 1 hour or, for the best flavor, make it the night before.
Step 4
As chile oil simmers, prepare the seed mix: Heat oven to 425 degrees. On a rimmed sheet pan, lay out sesame seeds and pepitas in a single layer, transfer to the oven and toast until golden and fragrant, about 6 minutes. Let cool slightly, then mix in peanuts and garlic flakes. Set aside.
Step 5
Prepare the sautéed kale: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm oil until it shimmers. Add kale to the skillet, a couple of handfuls at a time, stirring to combine and adding more kale to the skillet as it wilts and space permits. (Kale will release liquid, but if you think it needs more oil, add it to the pan.) When the last batch has been added, season generously with salt. Add vinegar and about ½ tablespoon red-pepper flakes scooped from the chile oil, and stir to incorporate. You want some wilted bits and some crunchier drier bits. Set over low heat as you fry your eggs.
Step 6
Prepare the eggs: In another large nonstick skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil. Working in batches, cook 1 to 2 eggs per person, adding oil as needed, until the yolk is a desired consistency, 2 to 3 minutes for sunny-side up.
Step 7
Plate the dish: Dollop about ¼ cup yogurt onto the center of each plate, spread it in a circle, leaving space around the edge of the plate for the seeded oil and a divot in the middle for the greens. Spoon 3 to 4 tablespoons chile oil around the edge of the yogurt, and sprinkle seed mix over the oil. Divide warm greens on top of yogurt, and top with eggs. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and serve immediately.

cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving

Salt and black pepper
1
(15-ounce) can white beans, rinsed and patted very dry
1
teaspoon smoked paprika
2
oranges","124 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Take the burrata out of the fridge to let it warm to room temperature. Heat the oven to 400 degrees and, if desired, line a sheet pan with parchment or foil for easier cleanup. On the sheet pan, toss the broccoli rabe with 2 tablespoons olive oil and salt until coated. Spread it out (it will be crowded).
Step 2
In a medium bowl, stir together the white beans, 1 tablespoon olive oil, the smoked paprika, a pinch of salt and lots of black pepper until coated. Spoon the beans over the broccoli rabe; set aside the bowl (no need to rinse). Roast until the broccoli rabe is tender and crisp in spots, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool slightly.
Step 3
Meanwhile, cut off the top and bottom of the oranges and set it on one of the flat, cut sides. Follow the curve of the fruit to cut away the peel and pith. Squeeze the peels into the reserved bowl to get out any juice. Cut the fruit in half from top to bottom, then slice into ¼-inch-thick half-moons and pluck out the seeds. If your pieces are especially large, halve them again. Transfer the fruit and any juice on the cutting board to the bowl. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt and stir to combine.
Step 4
To eat, transfer the broccoli, beans and burrata to a platter or plates, then top with the orange slices and a drizzle of the juices in the bowl. Season with more salt, pepper and olive oil as you like.

4
(6-ounce) fish fillets, such as arctic char, striped bass or salmon, skin on or off

Salt

Extra-virgin olive oil, for greasing","433 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
To make the pesto, add the pistachios, capers and 1 teaspoon salt to a food processor and process until coarsely chopped. Add the herbs, citrus juice and a pinch of salt and pulse until the herbs are finely chopped and the nuts are about the size of sesame seeds. Add the olive oil and pulse just until combined. Stir in 1 teaspoon of citrus zest. Taste, then continue to add more zest and salt until the pesto is citrusy and punchy. Thin with 2 to 3 more tablespoons of olive oil until it’s the consistency of a loose paste. Taste, and adjust seasonings as needed. (To use the pesto on pasta, see Tip.)
Step 2
To make the fish, season it all over with salt and oil. Working in batches if necessary, add the fish (skin-side down, if your fillets are skin-on) to a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, then heat over medium. Cook until the flesh is opaque ¾ of the way up the sides, 6 to 12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish. If the fish is buckling, press it down with a spatula so it makes contact with the skillet. Flip and cook until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to plates, skin-side up if serving skin-on fish, and eat with a spoonful of pesto.
To make pesto pasta, skip the additional 2 to 3 tablespoons oil and toss the thick pesto with cooked pasta and a little pasta cooking water. Leftovers keep for up to 3 days.

eggs (from the refrigerator or at room temperature; either is fine)
½
teaspoon table salt

Freshly ground black or white pepper
2
tablespoons minced fresh herbs, such as chives, tarragon, parsley and chervil (optional)
¼
cup heavy cream or crème fraîche

Buttered toast, for serving","1291 user ratings","5 minutes, plus optional resting","Step 1
Break the eggs into a bowl. Add the salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add most of the herbs (if using), reserving a big pinch to garnish the finished eggs. Using a fork, beat the eggs very thoroughly, at least 30 seconds, until no streaks of white remain. You can proceed to Step 2 right away, but for even more tender results, allow the eggs to rest 10 to 15 minutes after salting and beating them. Have a silicone spatula and a serving plate at hand before you begin cooking.
Step 2
Heat 3 tablespoons of the cream in a small (8-inch) nonstick, well-seasoned cast-iron or carbon-steel skillet over medium-high heat until it bubbles vigorously, about 30 to 45 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low.
Step 3
Drizzle the eggs from the bowl into the cream in a thin, steady stream, moving the bowl so that the eggs are drizzled all along the surface of the pan. Let the eggs rest for about 15 seconds, then begin stirring and folding slowly and steadily with the spatula until the eggs are as done as you like them. Remove the pan from heat and immediately drizzle in the remaining cream and stir vigorously to incorporate. Immediately transfer to the serving plate, sprinkle with remaining herbs and a few grinds of black pepper. Serve right away with toast.
This recipe can be doubled, using a 10-inch skillet instead of an 8-inch skillet.
For Velvety Brown-Butter Eggs, cooking eggs directly in browned butter can lead to tough, overcooked curds and a greasy texture. Browning the butter separately and cooling down the pan with cream before adding the eggs solves these issues, giving you tender, custardy eggs rich with brown butter flavor.

Cook eggs through the end of Step 1. Skip Step 2. Instead, heat 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a small nonstick, well-seasoned cast-iron or carbon-steel skillet over medium-high heat, swirling constantly until the butter melts, foaming subsides, the milk solids take on a deep brown color and the butter gets a rich, nutty aroma. Immediately add 3 tablespoons of the cream and shake the pan to incorporate the butter. The cream should bubble vigorously almost immediately. Reduce heat to medium-low and proceed with Step 3 as written.

1
teaspoon ground white pepper
1

2
(packed) cups shredded cooked chicken (about 10 ounces)

½
medium red onion, finely chopped (about ½ cup)
6
large eggs
½
cup sour cream, thinned with water until easy to drizzle

Sliced black olives, minced red bell pepper and sliced scallions, for garnish (optional)","458 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Prepare the chicken filling: In a medium saucepan, combine poblano, tomato, salt, oregano, white pepper and garlic with 3½ cups water. Bring to a boil over high, then cook over medium heat for 30 minutes. Add chicken, cook for an additional 10 minutes, then stir in cilantro.
Step 2
While the filling cooks, prepare the red enchilada sauce and green enchilada sauce. (You also can prepare both sauces first and keep them warm over low heat.)
Step 3
When ready to assemble the enchiladas, heat the broiler and set an oven rack a few inches away from it. (It is tricky to assemble all six servings of enchiladas at once, but they can be assembled in batches or cooked off one or two at a time. The components all store well refrigerated for a few days.)
Step 4
Heat a medium skillet over medium. Add a layer of vegetable oil that is about the thickness of a corn tortilla and heat over medium-high. Using tongs, dip tortillas in hot oil, quickly cooking on both sides just until warmed without allowing tortillas to become crisp, about 20 seconds per side. Transfer warmed tortillas to a plate and continue until all are fried, adding oil as needed.
Step 5
Stack one serving of enchiladas at a time: Dip 1 tortilla in red sauce until fully coated and place on an ovenproof rimmed plate, bowl or baking dish that is slightly wider than the tortilla. Top with ⅓ cup of black beans and a sprinkling of the cheese.
Step 6
Dip a second tortilla into the red sauce, then place it on top. Top the second tortilla with ½ cup of chicken filling, spreading it in an even layer. Dip a third tortilla into the green sauce until fully coated, then set it on top of the chicken filling. Liberally top half of the top tortilla with red sauce and the other half with green sauce; sprinkle generously with cheese and red onion.
Step 7
Assemble remaining tortilla stacks.
Step 8
Heat the enchiladas under the broiler, working in batches, until cheese is well melted, 1 to 2 minutes. While cheese is melting, fry eggs in a skillet, in batches as needed.
Step 9
Top each serving with a fried egg; season the egg with salt. Drizzle each serving liberally with the loosened sour cream. Top with garnishes, as desired, and serve immediately.

8
ounces fresh or thawed frozen tteok (cylindrical Korean rice cakes), chopped into bite-size pieces
1
(5-gram) packet gim (roasted seaweed), scissored into thin strips","58 user ratings","2¾ hours","Step 1
Make the broth: Soak the brisket in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes. Drain the brisket then add it to a large stockpot, along with the radish, onion, salt and 6 quarts cold water. Bring to a boil over high, skimming and discarding foam. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the meat is very tender, 1½ to 2 hours. Turn off the heat.
Step 2
Meanwhile, prepare the mandu: Heat the olive oil and gochugaru in a small pot over medium, stirring occasionally, just until the gochugaru begins to sizzle, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a heatproof bowl to cool completely; it will thicken as it sits.
Step 3
Place the grated onion in a fine-mesh sieve or kitchen towel and press out as much liquid as you can into a bowl. Reserve the liquid. Add the grated onion to a large bowl, along with the kimchi, brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg, ¾ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper and 2 tablespoons of the gochugaru mixture; stir to combine. Add the ground beef and gently stir again to combine.
Step 4
To assemble the mandu, set a small dish of cold water next to a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Place about ½ tablespoon of the filling into the center of a mandu wrapper. Dip your fingertips into the cold water then wet the entire outer edge of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half over the filling to create a half-moon shape and press the edges to seal, making sure to push out any air bubbles. If you’d like, make at least three pleats along the edge. Place on the sheet pan and repeat with the rest of the filling and wrappers. Freeze the dumplings directly on the sheet pan until ready to cook. (Once the dumplings are frozen solid, you can transfer them to a sealable bag and keep them in the freezer for up to 2 months.)
Step 5
Make the egg yolk omelet garnish for the soup: Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium and add enough oil to lightly coat the bottom. Whisk the egg yolks and add to the skillet, tilting the pan to spread the yolks into an even layer. Cook until just set on the first side without browning, about 30 seconds, and flip to cook the second side, just a few more seconds. Transfer to a cutting board to cool completely. Roll like a sleeping bag and thinly slice crosswise to create little yellow strips.
Step 6
Remove the brisket, radish and onion from the broth. Thinly slice the brisket against the grain and return it to the pot, and eat (or discard) the radish and onion. Add the reserved onion liquid, taste and season with salt and pepper.
Step 7
To serve, bring the broth to a boil over high. Add the chilled mandu, reduce the heat to a simmer and cook, gently stirring occasionally, just until the mandu float to the top, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the tteok and continue cooking until the tteok are tender, 1 to 2 minutes.
Step 8
Divide the broth, beef, mandu and tteok among bowls. Top each with the egg yolk omelet and gim. Drizzle with as much of the remaining gochugaru oil as you like. Serve hot.
You can find gochugaru, or red pepper powder, at Korean or Asian supermarkets and at many grocery stores, as well as online. It ranges from a fine dust to tiny coarse flakes. For this dish, buy the coarse variety.

cups/473 milliliters cold heavy whipping cream
2
tablespoons granulated sugar
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
1½
cups/34 grams freeze-dried raspberries","385 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Prepare the cake: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 325 degrees.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, add the flour and baking powder. Whisk to combine and to break up any lumps.
Step 3
Add the butter to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Use the empty butter wrappers to generously grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan; line the bottom and long sides with parchment. Add the cream cheese, sugar, vanilla and salt to the bowl with the butter and mix on medium-low speed to combine. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat until fluffy, almost white and the sugar is mostly dissolved, 5 to 7 minutes. With the mixer on medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, mixing until smooth after each addition. Use a flexible spatula to scrape the bowl, then beat over medium speed for another minute.
Step 4
With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients and mix until most of the flour streaks have disappeared. Using the spatula, scrape the bowl and gently stir until you eliminate the flour streaks. Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, then smooth out the top.
Step 5
Bake, rotating the pan halfway through, until golden brown and a skewer or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 60 to 65 minutes. When you gently press on the center of the cake with your fingertip, you shouldn’t leave a dent. Let cool completely in the pan. (The cooled cake can be covered and kept at room temperature for up to 3 or 4 days.)
Step 6
If you’re preparing the optional toppings, assemble the cake: Spread the preserves evenly over the cooled cake.
Step 7
In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the heavy whipping cream, sugar and salt over medium-high until billowy soft peaks form. When you lift the whisk out of the bowl and turn it upside-down, a peak of cream should flop over slightly like a Santa hat. Evenly spread the whipped cream over the jam-topped cake.
Step 8
Add the freeze-dried raspberries to a fine-mesh sieve and hold it over the cake. Using your fingers, pass them through until most of the magenta powder rests atop the frosting like fresh snow and most of the seeds are left behind in the sieve. The entire surface of the whipped cream should be covered in pink dust. Discard the raspberry seeds. Serve immediately.
Look for a brand of raspberry preserves with minimal ingredients: They should consist of only raspberries, sugar, pectin and some kind of citrus. That will taste more tart and less artificial than one with, say, high-fructose corn syrup and other fruit juices that muddy the natural raspberry flavor. If your preserves taste especially sweet, you can stir in up to 3 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice for added tartness.

Add shallots and shredded squash, and cook, stirring, until shallots are golden brown and the squash is soft and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. (If the squash starts to stick to the pan, splash in a little water.) Stir in ½ teaspoon salt, sage and a pinch of red-pepper flakes. Transfer to the bowl with the mushrooms, tossing gently to combine.
Step 3
Grease the bottom and sides of a broiler-safe 9-by-13-inch baking dish with butter.
Step 4
In another large bowl, whisk eggs until uniform in color. Whisk in milk, cream, ¼ cup of the Parmesan (save the rest for the top), 2 teaspoons salt, red-pepper flakes and a large pinch of black pepper. Whisk thoroughly to combine.
Step 5
Stir in the mozzarella, about ⅔ of the squash-mushroom mixture and the bread cubes until well coated. Pour bread mixture into the prepared baking dish in an even layer. Strew the remaining squash-mushroom mixture over top. Refrigerate, covered, until the bread absorbs all the liquid, at least 8 hours or overnight.
Step 6
When ready to bake, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Top the strata evenly with the remaining ½ cup Parmesan. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until set in the center. (It may puff a bit.) Run it under the broiler for 1 to 3 minutes to brown the top, watching carefully. Let sit for 10 minutes, then serve warm.

For the Assembly

cup/113 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature

Confectioners’ sugar","480 user ratings","3 hours, plus cooling and chilling","Step 1
Toast the hazelnuts: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Scatter the hazelnuts across a rimmed baking sheet and toast, shaking the baking sheet once halfway through, until the hazelnuts are golden and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Step 2
Once cooled, rub off and discard the skins. Measure out ¼ cup hazelnuts and coarsely chop, then set aside for sprinkling over the ring of choux.
Step 3
Caramelize the hazelnuts: Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Fill a glass with water, place a pastry brush inside and set aside. Combine 1 cup/200 grams granulated sugar, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ cup/60 grams water in a small, heavy saucepan and stir gently with a heatproof spatula over medium-high heat just until sugar dissolves to form a clear syrup, about 3 minutes. Let the mixture come to a boil and use the wet pastry brush to brush down the sides of the saucepan and dissolve any stuck-on sugar crystals. Boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan gently and brushing down the sides of the saucepan if you see crystals forming, until the syrup becomes viscous and takes on a pale golden color and the bubbles become large, glassy and slow to pop (a sign that the water has boiled off and caramelization is near), about 5 minutes. Turn the heat down to medium and continue to cook, keeping a close watch and frequently swirling the saucepan, until the bubbling has mostly subsided and the mixture is very fluid and has turned a deep amber, about 4 minutes. Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat, add the 1 cup whole toasted hazelnuts and stir thoroughly with the spatula, scraping the bottom and sides, just until the nuts are coated. Working quickly before the caramel starts to harden, scrape the mixture out onto the lined baking sheet and spread the nuts in an even layer. Set the baking sheet aside and let the caramelized nuts cool completely.
Step 4
Make the praline paste: Break up the cooled slab of caramelized hazelnuts into pieces, then transfer the pieces to a large resealable bag. Press out the air and seal the bag, then bash the pieces with a rolling pin until they’re broken into bits about the size of a pine nut. Transfer to a food processor along with the almond butter. Process the mixture, occasionally stopping to scrape down the sides, until you have a smooth, fluid paste with as little grit as possible, about 5 minutes. Scrape the paste into a lidded container, cover and set aside.
Step 5
Make the pastry cream: Have a clean medium bowl at the ready. Combine the milk, vanilla seeds or paste, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt in a small, heavy saucepan (if using vanilla extract, you’ll add it later). Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium heat, whisking once or twice, then remove from the heat.
Step 6
Combine the cornstarch and remaining ¼ cup granulated sugar in a separate medium bowl and whisk to combine, then add the yolks and whisk vigorously until the mixture is very pale, light in texture and thick, about 2 minutes. (It will be very thick at first but will thin out as you work it.)
Step 7
Whisking the yolk mixture constantly, slowly stream about half of the hot milk mixture into the bowl. Then, whisking constantly, stream the yolk mixture back into the remaining milk mixture in the saucepan. Set the saucepan over medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the foam has subsided and the pastry cream is thick like pudding and holds the marks of the whisk, about 2 minutes. Stop whisking for several seconds and check for slow bubbling beneath the surface, an indication that the pastry cream is at a boil. When you see bubbling, immediately remove the saucepan from the heat and scrape into the reserved bowl. (If you don’t see bubbling, continue whisking vigorously and pause to check every 20 seconds or so.) Whisk the chilled butter into the hot pastry cream a few pieces at a time until smooth. (If using vanilla extract, whisk it in.) Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the pastry cream and refrigerate until it’s cold, at least 4 hours.
Step 8
Cook the dough for the pâte à choux: In a small saucepan, combine the milk, butter, granulated sugar, salt and 6 tablespoons/76 milliliters water and bring the mixture to a lively simmer over medium-low heat, stirring with a wooden spoon to melt the butter. Once you see active bubbling across the surface, add the flour all at once and stir slowly to incorporate, then stir more vigorously to bring together a soft dough. (A film will also form along the sides and bottom of the saucepan.) Continue to cook the dough over medium heat, using the spoon to smack it aggressively against the sides of the saucepan, until it’s shiny and holds together in a firm ball, 3 to 4 minutes. You want to make sure the dough has a chance to dry out and the flour loses its raw taste.
Step 9
Beat in the eggs: Scrape the dough into a medium bowl and set aside for about a minute to cool, stirring once or twice to help release steam. Add a couple of tablespoons of beaten eggs to the bowl with the dough and mix with the wooden spoon until the dough absorbs the egg and the mixture is thick but smooth. (The dough will lose its cohesiveness when you add the egg but will come back together with a bit of mixing.) Beat in the remaining eggs a couple of tablespoons at a time, waiting until the dough smooths out before adding more, until you’ve added all but about 3 tablespoons. Set aside the remaining egg for brushing over the choux. The dough will become glossier and looser after each addition. Take a look at the consistency — it should be thick, smooth and glossy, and when you let it fall off the spoon it should leave a v-shaped trail. (If it seems very thick, dribble in a little more beaten egg and stir, but make sure to leave about 2 tablespoons egg for brushing the choux.) Scrape the dough into a large pastry bag or resealable plastic bag. Twist or seal the bag to close, squeezing out as much air as possible, then set aside at room temperature to allow the dough to set up for 15 to 20 minutes. Snip a 1-inch-wide opening in the tip of the bag.
Step 10
Pipe the pâte à choux: Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Turn over a sheet pan and line the turned-up side with a piece of parchment paper. Trace a 9- or 10-inch circle (a smaller ring will puff more, while a larger one will lay flatter; use a dinner plate or cake pan as your guide) onto the parchment paper with a permanent marker, then turn the parchment over (dab a bit of the pâte à choux in the four corners of the pan underneath the parchment so it doesn’t slide around). Applying even pressure to the bag, pipe a ring of choux around the inside of the traced circle, overlapping the dough slightly where the ends meet. Pipe a second ring of dough inside the first so the two are touching, but starting and ending at a different point. Using all of the remaining dough, pipe a third ring over top of the first two, nestling it in between them and starting and ending at a third point. If you have any remaining pâte à choux, pipe it along the circle to fill in any thinner spots. Using a gentle scraping motion, drag the tines of a fork all along the dough to lightly score the surface and help blend the rings together (this will help it puff more evenly). Brush the entire surface of the dough with the reserved beaten egg, then sprinkle the reserved hazelnuts evenly over top.
Step 11
Bake and cool: Bake the ring for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue to bake until it’s puffed and deep golden brown, another 35 to 45 minutes. Avoid the temptation to open the door at this point: It’s important that the dough thoroughly dry out in the oven, or it will collapse, making it hard to fill. Turn off the oven, then open the door and use the tip of a paring knife to poke several holes in the top and side of the ring to allow steam to escape. Prop the door open with a wooden spoon and let the ring cool inside the oven for 1 hour, then remove it from the oven and let it cool completely.
Step 12
Make the mousseline filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat 1 cup/225 grams of room temperature butter and ⅔ cup of the praline paste on medium speed, pausing once to scrape down the sides of the bowl, until the mixture is very smooth and creamy, about 1 minute. (Reserve the remaining praline for assembly.) Beating constantly on medium speed, add the chilled pastry cream to the bowl a couple of tablespoons at a time, waiting until the cream is incorporated before adding more. Once all the pastry cream is added, stop the mixer, scrape down the sides of the bowl, then continue to beat just until the mixture is very smooth and light, about 1 minute. Scrape the mousseline into a pastry bag fitted with a large open star tip, taking care not to form air pockets, then twist the bag to close and set aside.
Step 13
Assemble the Paris-Brest: Use a serrated knife to slice evenly through the ring of pâte à choux horizontally, separating the taller portion of the ring from the base. Gently slide the upper ring off the base and onto a cutting board, then transfer the base to a serving platter. Spoon the reserved praline paste inside the base and spread it in an even layer, then pipe the mousseline in large rosettes inside the base, using it all and distributing evenly. Use a serrated knife to cut the upper ring into eighths, then use a fine-mesh strainer to dust the pieces with confectioners’ sugar. Place the pieces over the filling, reassembling them into a ring.
Step 14
To serve the Paris-Brest, slice between the pieces of the upper ring and down through the filling and base. Transfer slices to plates and serve immediately.
The Paris-Brest is best eaten right away while the choux is crisp, but leftovers will keep covered and refrigerated for up to 2 days. The pastry cream will keep, stored airtight in the refrigerator, for 5 days. The praline paste will keep, stored airtight at room temperature, for 1 week. The pâte à choux can also be refrigerated in the pastry bag for up to 1 day before baking. Let it come to room temperature before piping.

cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (3 ounces)
1
cup sour cream (8 ounces), for serving
1
bunch fresh dill, leaves and tender stems coarsely chopped, for serving","423 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Prepare the toppings, starting with the pickled celery: Place the celery in a small bowl. Add the rice vinegar and sugar, season with ½ teaspoon salt and ⅛ teaspoon pepper, then stir to combine. Cover the mixture and place it in the refrigerator until ready to serve.
Step 2
Prepare the roasted vegetable toppings: Position a rack in the center of the oven and another below it. Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
Step 3
Using a damp paper towel, wipe the mushrooms clean. Pluck the stems off the caps and transfer the stems to a large pot. Thinly slice the mushroom caps and transfer to a large bowl. Drizzle enough olive oil (5 to 6 tablespoons) to generously coat the sliced mushrooms; season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine and transfer to a large sheet pan in a single layer.
Step 4
Wash, peel, halve and thinly slice the red onions. Transfer the onion peels and any trimmings to the pot. Transfer the sliced onions to the empty bowl, drizzle with enough olive oil (about 3 tablespoons) to generously coat, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to combine and transfer to another large sheet pan in a single layer. (Save the bowl without washing it.)
Step 5
Place the onions on the center rack of the oven and the mushrooms on the lower rack. Roast the vegetables until deeply golden brown at the edges, stirring them halfway through, 30 to 40 minutes.
Step 6
While the vegetables roast, make the broth: Fill the pot with 8 cups cold tap water, add the bay leaves and season with 1 tablespoon salt and ⅛ teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil over high, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes. Strain into the reserved bowl, discard the vegetable scraps and transfer the stock back to the pot. Bring to a simmer and keep at a gentle simmer over low heat. Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a kettle or saucepan.
Step 7
Make the risotto: In a large Dutch oven, add enough olive oil to generously coat the bottom. Heat the oil over medium. Add the shallots, celery and chestnuts, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are soft but not brown, 7 to 9 minutes. Add more olive oil if the pot looks dry. Add the rice and stir continuously until each grain is coated in the fat and looks shiny and translucent at the edges, about 1 minute.
Step 8
Pour in 1 cup of the simmering stock and stir vigorously until the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Add another cup of stock and stir occasionally until the rice has absorbed that stock. Continue like this, adding a cup of stock at a time and stirring just enough to make sure the rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot (every 3 to 5 minutes). When you’re out of the stock, continue with the boiling water, cooking until the rice grains are tender but maintain defined edges. This entire process will take anywhere from 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and cover.
Step 9
In a bowl, stir ¼ cup of boiling water with the miso until smooth. Add this miso mixture, the butter and cheese to the risotto and stir until incorporated. Serve the risotto immediately, with the roasted mushrooms and onions, quick-pickled celery, sour cream and dill in separate bowls with serving spoons so that guests can top their risotto themselves.

Heat the oven to 400 degrees.
Step 2
In a large bowl, mix together the butternut squash, maple syrup and cinnamon with 1 tablespoon oil and 1 teaspoon salt. Spread onto a large baking sheet and bake until just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, let cool for 15 minutes, then transfer back to the bowl and refrigerate until needed.
Step 3
Meanwhile, add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil to a medium saucepan; heat over medium-high. Once hot, stir in the leek, scallions, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks have softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon za’atar and stir 1 minute more, until fragrant, then stir in the chard and 1 tablespoon water. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, just until the leaves have wilted, then remove from the heat. Transfer the mixture to a separate bowl and set aside to cool for 15 minutes, then refrigerate until needed.
Step 4
In a medium bowl, use a spatula to combine the cream cheese, feta and a good crack of pepper. Stir this into the butternut squash mixture then return to the fridge.
Step 5
On a clean work surface, unroll or unfold both sheets of puff pastry; roll each into a 10-by-16-inch rectangle. Cut one sheet down to a 6-by-16-inch rectangle, and, if you like, use small festive cutters to cut out shapes from the trim. Place the trimmed puff pastry sheet on a large, parchment-lined baking sheet; pierce it all over with a fork then use a knife to lightly mark a 1-inch border around the edges.
Step 6
Spoon the cooled leek mixture on top of the base of the trimmed puff pastry sheet, avoiding the edges, then dollop the butternut squash mixture on top. Brush the border with some of the beaten egg. Take your other sheet of pastry, drape it over the pie and trim the excess dough. Use a fork to press down and seal the border, then trim and discard any rough edges. Brush the pie and the cutouts (if using) with some of the remaining beaten egg, then arrange the cutouts on top of the pie. Sprinkle all over with the remaining 1½ teaspoons za’atar. Refrigerate the pie on its baking sheet, uncovered, for at least 1 hour, or overnight if getting ahead.
Step 7
When ready to bake the pie, heat the oven to 425 degrees.
Step 8
Bake the chilled pie until golden, about 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees and cook for a further 45 minutes, or until cooked through.

Wipe the skillet out, or if there are burnt bits in the skillet, rinse and dry it. Return to medium heat and cook the pepperoni, stirring often, until it starts to brown and the pan looks oily, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the bread crumbs and cook, stirring often, until browned and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes. If at any point you don’t hear sizzling, that means the pan’s dry, so add more oil. (Turkey pepperoni is leaner than pork and will need additional oil.) Stir in the parsley, if using, then pile the crumbs on top of the chicken.

teaspoons red-pepper flakes, or more to taste
1
garlic clove, thinly sliced
2
teaspoons tomato paste
1
pound (uncooked) spaghetti","310 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
In a medium saucepan, heat the tomato sauce with 3½ cups water over medium heat. Stir to combine and bring the tomato broth to a simmer.
Step 2
Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a 12- to 14-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium.
Step 3
Add red-pepper flakes and garlic to the skillet and cook, stirring, until garlic is just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, press it into the pan to spread it out, and cook until it begins to melt and toast.
Step 4
Using a ladle or big spoon, add about ½ cup of the warm tomato broth to the pan and swirl to combine with the other ingredients.
Step 5
Carefully place the spaghetti into the pan on top of the sauce. (The spaghetti should fit lengthwise, but you can break the strands to fit in your pan, if need be.) Ladle 1 cup of the tomato broth on top of the pasta. Using a fork, move the spaghetti strands until evenly coated, pressing the spaghetti to distribute the broth until it evenly coats the pasta.
Step 6
Allow the pasta to cook for 3 minutes. Once the broth is absorbed, add 1½ cups tomato broth and repeat the process. As the pasta softens, move the strands out so they begin to create an even layer in the skillet.
Step 7
Add another 1½ cups broth. Rearrange the pasta again so it’s in an even layer and covered in liquid, and cook another 3 minutes.
Step 8
At the 9-minute mark, the pasta should begin to crackle and sizzle. Gently lift the pasta and peek underneath it. There should be crispy, almost burnt pieces. If so, flip the pasta. If not, increase heat a bit until it crisps, then flip and continue.
Step 9
Once the pasta is flipped, add the remaining broth. At this point, the pasta should be soft enough to easily move in the pan. Continue cooking until broth is absorbed and pasta is cooked through but still al dente. (If your pasta is still on the firmer side, you can add a splash of water, if needed, and cook until al dente.)

Heat air fryer to 400 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.
Step 2
If working with a smaller air fryer basket, cut bacon strips in half crosswise so the bacon can fit comfortably without any overhang. Arrange the bacon flat in a single layer.
Step 3
Cook until the bacon is browned and starts to ripple (or to desired doneness), about 8 minutes, flipping the bacon halfway through. The cook time may vary, depending on the thickness of your bacon and your desired crispiness. Cook the bacon for 1 to 2 more minutes, if using thicker bacon or if you like your bacon on the crispier side.
Step 4
Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, if needed.

Pat pork chops dry with paper towels. Season the pork chops with salt on both sides. In a shallow plate or small bowl, combine the sugar, cumin and coriander. Season pork chops all over with cumin mixture, rubbing until fully coated. (Pork chops can be seasoned just before cooking or up to 12 hours in advance. If seasoning the pork chops in advance, let them sit, uncovered, in the refrigerator, to allow the salt and sugar to settle into the pork chops, permeating and tenderizing them. Let the pork chops come to room temperature before cooking.)
Step 3
Transfer seasoned pork chops to the air fryer basket and cook until beautifully browned and cooked through, flipping halfway through, about 5 minutes per side. Allow pork chops to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.

Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.
Step 2
Pat chicken breast dry with a paper towel. Cut chicken breast in half crosswise into two pieces of equal weight, creating one shorter, thicker piece and one longer, thinner piece. Season chicken generously on all sides with salt and pepper; rub brown sugar all over. (Chicken breast can be seasoned and left uncovered for up to 12 hours in the refrigerator. Let the chicken come to room temperature before cooking.)
Step 3
In a medium bowl, combine the rice vinegar, soy sauce and olive oil. Toss chicken in soy sauce mixture until well coated and allow chicken to sit in marinade for 5 minutes.
Step 4
Transfer chicken to the air fryer basket, setting leftover marinade aside. Cook for 6 minutes and flip the chicken over. Spoon the remaining marinade over chicken. Cook until chicken is lightly browned, the sauce has turned slightly sticky on the chicken and the internal temperature at the thickest part of the meat reaches 165 degrees, another 6 to 10 minutes. The thicker half of the breast may need a few more minutes to cook through than the smaller piece.
Step 5
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board to rest for at least 5 minutes so the juices can settle and redistribute. Slice the chicken against the grain. Pour any sauce left at the bottom of the air fryer over the chicken and serve. For some extra brightness, squeeze lime wedge all over the chicken, if desired.

2
teaspoons turbinado or other coarse raw sugar (optional)
2
limes
1
tablespoon yuzu or lime juice

Toasted white sesame seeds, for sprinkling","781 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.
Step 2
Place the salmon on the prepared pan skin (or flat) side down at an angle, if needed, to fit. Sprinkle with salt (about 1 teaspoon) and the togarashi.
Step 3
In a small saucepan, stir ¼ cup crème fraîche with 1 tablespoon miso until well blended. Scrape onto the fish (save the pan without washing it), then spread the sauce in an even layer. If you like a little sweetness with your salmon, sprinkle it with the sugar.
Step 4
Roast the salmon until a thin-bladed paring knife slides through the thickest part with only a little resistance, 15 to 20 minutes. When you remove the blade from the fish and touch it, it should feel warm.
Step 5
While the fish roasts, stir the remaining ¾ cup crème fraîche and 1 tablespoon miso until smooth in the same saucepan. Set over low heat and warm, stirring occasionally, until steaming and tiny bubbles form around the edges, about 5 minutes. Don’t let the mixture boil. Turn the heat to the lowest setting to keep warm.
Step 6
Using the parchment or foil, lift the roasted salmon onto a serving platter, then slide the parchment or foil out from under the fish. Zest the limes all over the fish, then squeeze 1 tablespoon juice, if using lime juice. Stir the yuzu or lime juice into the miso cream, then transfer to a serving bowl to serve alongside the salmon. (Or, if your salmon is skinless, pour the sauce around the salmon.)
Step 7
Sprinkle the salmon with sesame seeds. Cut the zested limes into wedges and serve with the fish.
You also can use red or brown miso, but they’re both saltier. If using, you’ll want to sprinkle the salmon more lightly with salt.

cup/200 grams granulated sugar
⅔
cup/66 grams sweetened shredded coconut
1
large egg
1
tablespoon heavy cream or whole milk
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
1
(14- to 16-ounce) package puff pastry, preferably made with butter, thawed if frozen, but still cold","477 user ratings","25 minutes, plus chilling ","Step 1
In a medium mixing bowl, combine sugar and shredded coconut. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together egg, heavy cream and salt to make an egg wash and set aside.
Step 2
Place a sheet of parchment paper (about 12 by 16 inches) on a clean work surface. Unfold dough and roll the chilled puff pastry dough to about ⅛ inch thick (about an 11-by-15-inch rectangle). Generously brush egg wash over the top of the pastry. Sprinkle half of the coconut-sugar mixture in an even layer all over the egg-washed surface. Using a rolling pin, gently press coconut-sugar mixture into dough. Gently slide the pastry (still on the parchment paper) onto a cookie sheet. Cover lightly with another sheet of parchment and refrigerate until firm, 10 to 20 minutes.
Step 3
Once chilled, remove pastry from refrigerator. Using another cookie sheet or wire cooling rack, invert the pastry so the coconut-topped side is now on the bottom. Slide dough, still sandwiched between parchment, onto the countertop. Remove the top piece of parchment and set aside. Brush the puff pastry with the egg wash. Sprinkle evenly with remaining coconut-sugar mixture, and use a rolling pin to press it into the pastry dough. Carefully transfer pastry (still on the parchment) to a cookie sheet and cover again with the other sheet of parchment. Refrigerate until firm, 10 to 20 minutes.
Step 4
Remove pastry from the fridge, and remove the top layer of parchment. Using a sharp knife or pastry cutter, cut pastry into strips between ¼ and ½ inch (you can eyeball it). Return pan to the fridge to chill thoroughly, another 10 to 20 minutes.
Step 5
Line 2 or 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper. (You can reuse the parchment paper you’ve been using for the dough.) Working one strip at a time, transfer to prepared sheets and twist the two ends in opposite directions several times to create a long twist. Press the ends onto the parchment paper so they stick and don’t unfurl. Space coconut twists about 1 inch apart. Sprinkle any coconut that fell off the strips back on top of them.
Step 6
Place in pans, uncovered, in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes, or in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. The twists should be very firm and thoroughly chilled before baking. You can leave them in the fridge or freezer for up to 24 hours before baking, but if you leave them for more than an hour, cover them with plastic wrap so they don’t dry out.
Step 7
While the twists are chilling, heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 8
Bake twists until toasted and golden brown all over, 15 to 22 minutes, rotating sheet pans halfway through. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store for up to 1 week in an airtight container.

"Warak Dawali (Stuffed Grape Leaves) ","Middle Eastern,Allspice,Freezer Friendly,Ground Beef,Ground Cinnamon,Make Ahead,Project,Rice,Dinner,Appetizer,Main Course,Side Dish,Christmas","Yield: 6 to 8 servings","For the Filling
1
pound short- or medium-grain rice
4
tablespoons olive oil or melted butter (or a combination)
1
tablespoon fine sea salt
1
teaspoon tomato paste
1
teaspoon ground allspice
½
teaspoon ground cinnamon
½
teaspoon ground black pepper
¼
teaspoon grated nutmeg
1
pound ground beef
For the Grape Leaves
2
(16-ounce) jars grape leaves in brine (approximately 90 to 100 leaves for rolling; extras will be used to line the pot); see Tip
8
bone-in lamb chops (about 1½ pounds), 6 flanken-cut beef short ribs (about 2 pounds) or 1¾ pounds chuck roast (trimmed and cut into 6 to 8 even steaks); optional
3
tablespoons olive oil
3
medium tomatoes, sliced into ½-inch rounds
4
cups chicken broth or water
1
tablespoon tomato paste
1
tablespoon fine sea salt
½
teaspoon ground allspice
¼
teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼
teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
2
tablespoons lemon juice, or to taste

Plain yogurt, to serve","60 user ratings","5½ hours","Step 1
Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh sieve until the water runs almost clear, then soak in cold water for 15 minutes.
Step 2
While the rice soaks, prepare the grape leaves: Drain the leaves, separating them slightly, and set in a heatproof bowl. Pour boiling water over the leaves until fully submerged and let stand for 15 minutes.
Step 3
Drain the soaked rice, then let stand for 15 minutes.
Step 4
Meanwhile, parboil the lamb, short ribs or chuck roast, if using: Place your chosen meat in a pot just big enough to hold the pieces. Add enough cold water to barely cover. Bring to a boil over high, just until you see scum rise to the surface. Remove from the heat, discard the water, rinse the meat and set aside.
Step 5
Make the rice filling: In a large bowl, combine the rice, olive oil, salt, tomato paste, allspice, cinnamon, black pepper and nutmeg; mix well. Add the ground beef and mix until evenly combined; set aside.
Step 6
Drain and rinse the grape leaves thoroughly to remove the brine flavor. Stuff the leaves: Lay out as many of the leaves as will fit on a flat work surface with the vein side up and the stem end closer to you. (Aim for leaves that are about the size of an adult’s palm. If any are exceptionally bigger or smaller than that, set them aside to use for lining the pot later.) Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, cut out each tough central stem. Place 1 scant tablespoon of the rice filling above the cut-out stem section of each leaf. Using your fingers, spread the filling horizontally into a ¼-inch-thick log that is about 4 inches long, leaving a ½- to 1-inch border on either end. Fold the sides of the grape leaves over the filling, then, working from the end nearest to you, fold each leaf up to cover the filling, rolling away from you. Rolls should be tight enough that they hold but not so tight that there’s no space for the rice to expand. (If rolled too tightly, rolls may burst during cooking.) Repeat with the remaining grape leaves and filling.
Step 7
Assemble the pot: If using lamb, short ribs or chuck roast steak, heat the 3 tablespoons oil in a large Dutch oven or nonstick pot over medium heat. Working in 2 batches if necessary, sear the meat for a couple of minutes on both sides until browned. Remove the pot from the heat and nestle the tomato slices between the meat to fully cover the bottom. If you are not using the meat, drizzle the bottom of the pot with the olive oil and cover it with the tomato slices in an even layer.
Step 8
Creating one layer at a time, place the rolled grape leaves in either concentric circles or rows in the pot.
Step 9
In a large measuring cup, whisk the chicken broth or water with the tomato paste, salt, allspice, cinnamon and pepper to combine; pour the mixture over the grape leaves. Cover it with a layer or two of the extra, unrolled grape leaves and top with an inverted heatproof plate that’s slightly smaller than the pot’s diameter. (This prevents the leaves from moving around when liquid comes to a boil.)
Step 10
Cover the pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Allow to boil for about 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2 hours. After simmering, check the liquid content by tilting the pot to one side. If much more than a very thick trickle of liquid appears, then, using oven mitts or a tea towel to keep the inverted plate and leaves in place, carefully pour that liquid out into a very small pot or measuring cup and reserve (this can be used for reheating leftovers).
Step 11
Remove the plate, slightly lift the edge of the unrolled leaves, pour in the lemon juice and let cook over low heat for another 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside to rest for 20 minutes.
Step 12
To serve, discard the unrolled leaves on top. Select a serving dish slightly larger than the pot and invert the dish on top, then quickly — and very carefully — flip the pot and dish over, setting the dish on a surface and lifting the pot to reveal the stuffed grape leaves and meat, if using. (If you find the pot too heavy, then you can also use tongs to transfer the leaves and meat to the serving dish.) If you did not use a nonstick pot, some tomato slices may not release. You can discard them or scrape them out and add them to the platter.
Step 13
Shake the platter gently back and forth to help the stuffed grape leaves come apart, so you can serve individual pieces. Serve generously (at least 10 to 15 per person), with plain yogurt on the side.
Jarred, brined grape leaves can be found at any Middle Eastern grocery store or online. Opt for those labeled “California style,” which refers to leaves that tend to be younger, smaller, more tender and of the variety most similar to those used in the Middle East.

teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
For the (optional) Tahini Sauce
½
cup tahini
¼
cup lemon juice
¼
cup plain yogurt
½
teaspoon sea salt","80 user ratings","1½ hours, plus freezing","Step 1
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the shell: Place the beef cubes in a single layer on a parchment-lined plate or cutting board and put in the freezer to partially freeze (this makes grinding easier), about 1 hour.
Step 2
Start the filling by toasting the nuts: Add the walnuts and pine nuts to a baking sheet on separate sides, spread in an even layer and bake until lightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 3
Put the bulgur in a large bowl and soak in 1¾ cups of cold water. Allow to sit for 15 to 30 minutes, by which point the bulgur should have absorbed all the water.
Step 4
Heat the ¼ cup olive oil in a skillet over medium. Fry the diced onions until translucent and soft, stirring occasionally, about 8 minutes. Add the ground beef, salt, allspice, cinnamon and pepper and continue cooking, stirring to break up the meat, until any released water has evaporated, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, mix in the toasted nuts and set aside. The filling can be prepped up to 1 day in advance.
Step 5
Prepare the shell: Put the quartered onion, salt and spices into the bowl of a food processor and process until finely ground, scraping down the sides with a spatula, as needed. Add the partially frozen meat, in batches if necessary, and process until smooth and pasty. Add the soaked bulgur and pulse until combined. Transfer to a bowl and knead briefly until smooth and evenly combined. Dough can be used right away or covered and refrigerated up to 1 day.
Step 6
Heat the oven to 375 degrees and prepare a bowl of ice water nearby to wet your hands while you shape the kubbeh.
Step 7
Assemble the pie: Line a 10- to 12-inch round or 9-by-13-inch rectangular baking dish (metal is traditional, but glass will also do) with plastic wrap, leaving a generous overhang. Divide the shell mixture in half and spread one half, wetting your hands to make it easier, in an even layer over the base of the lined baking dish. Using the plastic overhang, lift this layer out of the pan and set aside. This will become the top of the pie.
Step 8
Generously grease the bottom and sides of your baking dish with ghee or olive oil. Spread the remaining shell mixture in an even layer in the bottom of the pan. Spoon in the filling and press it evenly into the shell with your hands. Take the top layer you prepared earlier and carefully flip it over the filling, discarding the plastic wrap. With wet hands, gently pat it down and smooth it out to fully cover the shell. Brush generously with ghee or olive oil.
Step 9
Using the tip of a sharp knife, score the top layer to form a geometric pattern, rinsing the knife between each cut. If using a rectangular dish, the most customary is a diamond pattern, which can be achieved with criss-crossing diagonal lines. If using a round dish, you can do diamonds or divide the circle into quarters or eighths then do a diamond pattern within each triangle. Once you have created your pattern, cut all the way through the bottom of the kubbeh along the lines that you want each serving size to be, whether you want smaller portions for an appetizer or larger portions for a main. If you are garnishing the top, you can firmly press a sliver of almond or a pine nut within each diamond shape.
Step 10
Bake, uncovered, for 35 to 45 minutes, until golden brown. Check it once or twice during cooking, and if it seems dry, brush with more ghee or olive oil. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving hot or at room temperature
Step 11
If you are preparing the tahini sauce, put all the ingredients in a bowl with 4 tablespoons of water and mix until smooth and evenly incorporated. It will seize at first, but keep stirring and it will smooth out. Serve alongside the kubbeh.
Bulgur comes in varying degrees of coarseness usually labeled as No. 1 (the finest), No. 2 and No. 3 at Middle Eastern grocery stores. The variety found in most large chain supermarkets is one of the coarser ones, so for this recipe it’s important you source the fine one, which can be purchased online or from any Middle Eastern grocer. It comes in both white and brown variations, but either works, as does a combination of the two.

Place figs in a heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Let sit until soft and pliable, 5 to 10 minutes, then drain well. Coarsely chop and set aside. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled puff pastry out about ⅛ inch thick to form a 13-by-11-inch rectangle. Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the pastry in half lengthwise so you have two long rectangles. Evenly divide the figs between the rectangles, spreading them into a 1-inch-wide strip that runs down the center of the pastry. Mound prosciutto on top of the figs.
Step 3
Lightly brush the long edges of the pastry with egg wash. Firmly fold the pastry over the filling to form long rolls. Cut each roll in half crosswise, then slice into 1-inch pieces and place them on the prepared baking sheet, seam side down. Cover with plastic or parchment and freeze for 30 minutes or refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to 6 hours.

On a piece of parchment paper, roll out the cold puff pastry into a 12-by-16-inch rectangle, about ⅛ inch thick. (If the rolling pin sticks, you can flour it very lightly.)
Step 3
Position puff pastry so the longer side is facing you. Lightly brush the egg wash across the pastry and sprinkle the za’atar-Parmesan mixture all over the egg-washed surface in an even layer, leaving a ¼-inch border on the longer side farthest from you. Using a rolling pin, gently roll over the top of the za’atar-Parmesan mixture. Save the remaining egg wash to use on the puff pastry before baking.
Step 4
Using a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut the puff pastry in half crosswise. Starting with the half closest to you, roll the dough into a tight log; finish with the ¼-inch border seam underneath, pinching it to seal. Repeat with remaining dough.
Step 5
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper (you can reuse the one you rolled the dough on).
Step 6
Transfer logs onto the prepared baking sheet. Cover with another piece of parchment and refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to 6 hours.
Step 7
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Uncover dough logs, and line another baking sheet with parchment. (You can use the one covering the logs.)
Step 8
Transfer the logs to a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, slice each log into ¼-inch-thick rounds. Using an offset spatula or metal spatula, place the pinwheels on parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. (You might need a third baking sheet; if they don’t all fit in your oven at the same time, refrigerate one baking sheet until ready to bake.)
Step 9
Using reserved egg wash, lightly brush egg onto pinwheels and sprinkle with more za’atar, and flaky salt and sesame seeds, if you like.
Step 10
Bake pinwheels until golden brown and puffed (some will puff into domes), 20 to 30 minutes, rotating sheet pans halfway through. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. These are best served warm, but will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

"Roasted Beef Tenderloin","Meat,Beef Tenderloin,Party,Soy Sauce,Sugar,Unsalted Butter,Worcestershire Sauce,Dinner,Main Course,Christmas,Hanukkah,New Year’s Day","Yield: 8 to 12 servings","1
whole (4-pound) beef tenderloin, peeled (trimmed) and tied (see Tip)
2
tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1
tablespoon soy sauce
2
teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
1
teaspoon granulated sugar

Coarse sea or kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper

Chopped parsley, for serving (optional)

Horseradish sauce, for serving","1617 user ratings","2 hours, plus trimming and tying, if needed","Step 1
Take the beef out of the refrigerator an hour before cooking so that it will cook evenly and not end up overdone on the outside while the center is still cold. Pat it very dry if it isn’t already.
Step 2
Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a large sheet pan with foil. Place the beef on the pan.
Step 3
Mix the butter, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce and sugar in a small bowl until the sugar dissolves. Pour the mixture all over the beef, using your hands to spread it around. Sprinkle the beef generously with salt (about 2 teaspoons) and press in an even coating of pepper (about 1 teaspoon).
Step 4
Roast until browned and a meat thermometer inserted in the center registers 120 to 125 degrees for medium-rare, 25 to 30 minutes. (Start checking at 20 minutes to make sure you don’t overcook the meat.) Use the foil to lift and transfer the beef with its juices to a cutting board. Let rest for 15 to 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the meat will rise 5 to 10 degrees as it rests.
Step 5
Transfer the beef to the cutting board, reserving the foil with its juices, and cut the beef into slices for serving. Arrange on a serving platter and pour over all of the juices from the foil and cutting board. Sprinkle with parsley, if you’d like, and serve with the horseradish sauce.
Beef tenderloin usually comes “peeled,” which means all of its excess fat and silverskin have been trimmed and the meat is tied at 1-inch intervals. You can ask the person at the meat counter to do it for you if it hasn’t been prepared, or you can trim and tie it yourself at home. To trim the meat, pull or slice off all excess fat and gristle, then slice off any silverskin, the thin, silvery white skin covering the meat. To tie the meat, tuck 4 to 5 inches of the thin, tapered end of the tenderloin under the meat to match the thickness of the other end of the meat and create an even cylinder. Use kitchen string to tie the meat at 1-inch intervals. This will hold the tucked-in end in place and also help the meat maintain its cylindrical shape while roasting.

Using a paring knife, slice off the ends of the plantains, removing about ½ inch from each tip. Then gently cut a slit in the skin through the length of the plantain, taking caution to avoid the flesh. Peel and discard the skin.
Step 2
Pour the oil into a large sauté pan and heat on medium until it shimmers. While the oil is heating, slice the plantains on a bias into ½-inch-thick pieces. Sprinkle the plantains with the salt.
Step 3
Prepare a paper towel-lined plate. Working in batches if necessary, carefully place the plantains in the oil and allow to cook until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side, using a slotted spoon or a spider strainer to flip each slice. The plantains should be soft in the middle but crisp around the edges. Transfer cooked plantains to the prepared plate.
Step 4
Once all the plantains are cooked, transfer to a serving plate, season with additional salt, if you like, and sprinkle with fresh lime juice. Serve immediately.

2
(21-ounce) cans cherry pie filling","703 user ratings","30 minutes, plus at least 4 hours’ chilling","Step 1
In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, butter and 1½ teaspoons salt. Stir thoroughly to combine, then set aside.
Step 2
Add the cream cheese, sugar and remaining salt to a large bowl, if using a hand mixer, or to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until the cream cheese has become fluffy and the sugar has started to dissolve, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the heavy cream, vanilla extract and almond extract (if using). Beat on low speed to combine, then raise the speed to medium-high and beat until medium peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.
Step 3
In a glass or metal 9-by-13-inch pan, add half of the graham cracker mixture and press firmly into an even layer. Add half of the cream mixture on top and smooth into an even layer, making sure it fully covers the graham cracker crust. Add both cans of cherry pie filling and gently smooth into an even layer over the cream mixture. Top with a layer of the remaining cream then the remaining graham cracker mixture. Cover and chill overnight (or at least 4 hours).

1
tablespoon chopped thyme
2
cups coarse dry bread crumbs
3
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
¼
cup chopped parsley","127 user ratings","4½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Cook the beans: Pick out and discard any debris, then rinse beans and put them in a large pot. Use a clove to pin a bay leaf to each onion half and add to the pot. Add about 8 cups water to cover the beans, set the pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Turn heat to low and let beans simmer until tender — cooked through but firm — 1 hour to 1½ hours, adding a large pinch of salt at the 30-minute mark. As beans cook, add water as necessary, keeping the liquid about an inch above the beans. Let beans cool in their own liquid. Taste for salt and adjust as needed.
Step 2
Meanwhile, cook the lamb: Season the shanks quite generously all over with salt and pepper. Let sit for an hour at room temperature or overnight in the fridge. Put the shanks in a large pot. Use a clove to pin a bay leaf to each onion half, and add to the pot. Add carrots and garlic cloves along with the orange peel, and fill the pot with about 8 cups water. Set the pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Turn heat to low and let simmer. Skim off any foam, then partly cover the pot. Cook until lamb is very tender and begins to fall from the bone when probed with a paring knife, about 1 hour 15 minutes to 1½ hours. Leave lamb to cool in the broth.
Step 3
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Once the lamb is cool enough to handle, strain the broth, taste and adjust seasoning, and reserve. Tear lamb into rough strips, about 1 inch by 2 inch. Chop the cooked carrots and onion, and add to the lamb. (Discard the garlic.)
Step 4
Drain the beans, reserving any liquid for future soups, and add them to a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Add the reserved lamb and vegetables, minced garlic and half of the rosemary and thyme, and mix with the beans. Taste and season. Push down on the mixture so it lays evenly, and add 2 cups lamb broth. (Beans should be just a little soupy before cooking, but not drowning.) Cover dish tightly with foil, place on a baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour, until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the dish bubbles at the edges.
Step 5
In a small bowl, mix together the remaining rosemary and thyme, bread crumbs and 3 tablespoons olive oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over beans and lamb, then pat them down over the surface of the lamb and vegetables so they moisten a bit. Drizzle over about 2 more tablespoons olive oil.
Step 6
Bake for 1 hour more, until the top is golden and the dish bubbles at the edges. (You may have to add up to 1 to 2 cups more lamb broth if the beans seem dry.) Sprinkle with parsley and serve.
This dish may be prepared up to 2 days in advance, and the flavors will actually improve with reheating. Cover with foil and reheat at 350 degrees, for 45 minutes, then remove foil and let topping brown for 15 minutes. (It will be necessary to moisten with more broth, as the beans will have absorbed most of the liquid.)

1
cup/240 grams whole milk
¼
cup/85 grams light corn syrup
2
tablespoons/42 grams honey","328 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes, plus at least 3 hours’ resting","Step 1
Toast the nuts: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Scatter the walnuts or pecans on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing once, until they’re golden brown and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Let the nuts cool on the baking sheet. Coarsely chop, then set the nuts aside.
Step 2
Prepare the pan: Lightly spray the inside of an 8-inch square pan with vegetable oil spray. Line the bottom and sides with parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles, then lightly spray the parchment paper. Set the pan aside.
Step 3
Melt the chocolate mixture: Fill a large, heavy saucepan with about an inch of water and bring to a simmer. In a large heatproof bowl (big enough to sit atop the saucepan and not touch the water), combine the chocolate, butter and salt, and set the bowl over the saucepan. Stir the mixture with a flexible spatula until completely melted and smooth, then carefully remove the bowl from the heat. Stir in the vanilla extract, then set the bowl aside.
Step 4
Cook the sugar mixture: Empty and dry the saucepan, and have at the ready a clean pastry brush, a spoon, a small bowl filled with very cold water and a separate large bowl. Add the sugar and cocoa powder to the saucepan, and whisk to combine and eliminate any lumps, then add the milk, corn syrup and honey. Set the saucepan over medium heat and stir the sugar mixture gently with a heatproof spatula until the sugar is mostly dissolved and it starts to bubble at the sides.
Step 5
Before the mixture comes to a rolling boil, dip the pastry brush in water and use the wet bristles to brush down the sides of the saucepan and dissolve any stuck-on sugar crystals. Let the mixture come to a boil, then clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan. Boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan gently and brushing down the sides of the saucepan with the wet pastry brush if you see crystals forming as it reduces. (This is to prevent crystallization, which would produce a crumbly, grainy fudge.)
Step 6
Test the mixture for “soft ball”: When the mixture reaches 235 degrees, reduce the heat to low and continue to cook. When it reaches 238 degrees, spoon about ½ teaspoon of the mixture into the bowl of cold water and let it cool for a few seconds, then fish it out and work it into a ball between your fingertips (the mixture can still be cooking meanwhile). If it forms a ball that holds its shape but flattens easily between your fingertips, the mixture is ready. If it is too soft to hold its shape, continue to cook over low until it reaches 240 degrees and repeat the soft ball test. Once you reach the soft ball stage, remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the mixture into the separate large bowl but do not scrape the bottom or sides.
Step 7
Let the mixture cool and beat the fudge: Scrape the reserved chocolate mixture into the bowl with the sugar mixture but do not stir. Thoroughly rinse and dry the candy thermometer, then clip it to the side of the bowl. Let the mixture cool until it registers 115 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the thermometer, then beat the mixture with a hand mixer on medium-low speed until it loses its shine and becomes creamy, 8 to 10 minutes. Stop the mixer, add the nuts and fold quickly with a flexible spatula until the nuts are distributed evenly. Working quickly, scrape the fudge into the prepared pan and smooth the surface, working it into an even layer all the way to the sides and corners. Let the fudge sit at room temperature until it’s firm, at least 3 hours.
Step 8
Cut the fudge: Use the parchment paper to lift the slab of fudge out of the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Use a chef’s knife to cut the slab in half in both directions to make 4 equal squares, then cut each square into a 3-by-3 grid for a total of 36 squares.
The fudge will keep, well wrapped and stored airtight at room temperature to prevent drying, for 1 week.

"Skillet Gingerbread Cake With Apple Butter","Cakes,Buttermilk,Cast Iron,Ground Cinnamon,Ground Ginger,Make Ahead,Molasses,Skillet,Snack,Dessert,Winter,Christmas,Thanksgiving","Yield: 12 to 16 servings","
Nonstick baker’s spray or cooking spray, for the pan
2¼
cups/288 grams all-purpose flour
½
cup/60 grams whole wheat flour
½
teaspoon baking soda
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
2
teaspoons ground ginger
1
teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼
teaspoon ground cloves
⅔
cup/135 grams granulated sugar
⅓
cup/75 grams packed brown sugar (light or dark)
5
tablespoons/70 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
⅓
cup/80 milliliters neutral oil
1
large egg, at room temperature
⅓
cup/80 milliliters unsulfured molasses
¾
cup/160 milliliters apple butter
¼
cup/60 milliliters buttermilk, at room temperature
⅓
cup/45 grams finely chopped crystallized ginger (see Tip)
2
tablespoons sanding sugar, for topping (optional)
3
tablespoons Swedish pearl sugar, for topping (optional)","419 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling","Step 1
Center a rack in the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Coat a 10-inch (7-cup) cast iron skillet with bakers’ or cooking spray and set aside.
Step 2
Whisk the all-purpose and whole wheat flours together with the baking soda, salt and spices.
Step 3
Working in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the granulated and brown sugars and the butter together at medium speed for about 3 minutes. The mixture will be pasty and that’s fine. Pour in the oil and beat for another 2 minutes. (Don’t wash the measuring cup before using it for the molasses. The oily residue will help the molasses slide out of the cup easily.) Add the egg and beat for a minute. With the mixer on low, beat in the molasses followed by the apple butter.
Step 4
Add half the flour mixture and, still working on low, mix until it just disappears into the batter. Blend in the buttermilk, followed by the remainder of the flour mixture. When it’s almost incorporated, mix in the ginger. You’ll have a thick batter. Scrape it into the skillet, nudging it into the corners of the pan and smoothing the top. If using, sprinkle over the sanding sugar then top with the pearl sugar.
Step 5
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until the top of the gingerbread is uniformly puffed, the cake starts to pull away from the sides of the pan and, most important, a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Transfer the skillet to a rack and let the cake cool until it’s just warm or reaches room temperature before cutting. Left in the skillet and well covered, the cake will keep at room temperature for about 5 days.
The crystallized ginger needs to be moist and pliable. If it’s not, soak it in hot water for 30 seconds, drain and pat dry.

"Nougat With Honey and Pistachios","Candies,Coconut Oil,Corn Syrup,Egg White,Honey,Make Ahead,Pistachio,Plan Ahead,Sugar,Dessert,Christmas,Hanukkah","Yield: About 50 pieces","
Vegetable oil spray
2½
cups/314 grams shelled, skinless pistachios (see Tip)
3
large egg whites
1
tablespoon/13 grams plus 1¼ cups/250 grams granulated sugar
½
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
¼
cup/87 grams light corn syrup
½
cup/188 grams honey
3
tablespoons refined coconut oil or cocoa butter, melted
2
teaspoons vanilla extract","265 user ratings","45 minutes, plus at least 6 hours’ cooling","Step 1
Prepare the pan: Lightly coat the inside of an 8-inch square pan with vegetable oil spray. Line the bottom and sides with parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles, then lightly spray the parchment paper. Set the pan aside.
Step 2
Toast the nuts: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Scatter the pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet and toast, tossing once, until they’re golden and fragrant, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 200 degrees, then remove the pistachios from the oven, and let them cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes. If needed, wrap loosely in a clean kitchen towel and rub off as much of their skins as you can. Turn off the oven, and return the baking sheet to the still-warm oven to keep the nuts warm.
Step 3
Prepare to make the nougat: Combine the egg whites, 1 tablespoon/13 grams sugar and the salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the corn syrup, remaining 1¼ cups/250 grams sugar and ¼ cup/57 grams water, and set aside. Fill a glass with water, place a pastry brush inside, and set aside.
Step 4
Cook and stream in the honey: Place the honey in a separate small saucepan and clip a candy thermometer to the side. Bring the honey to a boil over medium heat and cook, swirling the saucepan occasionally. When the honey reaches 235 degrees, turn the mixer on medium-low and beat the egg white mixture until the whites are broken up, about 20 seconds, then increase the speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the mixture forms medium peaks, about 1 minute. When the honey registers 248 degrees, remove the saucepan from the heat and, with the mixer on medium-high, very slowly stream the honey into the egg white mixture, pouring it down the side of the bowl and avoiding the whisk to prevent splatter. Continue to beat on medium-high until the mixer bowl is warm (not hot) to the touch.
Step 5
Meanwhile, cook and stream in the sugar: While the egg white mixture is whipping, set the saucepan with the sugar mixture over medium-high heat and stir gently with a heatproof spatula just until sugar dissolves to form a clear syrup, about 2 minutes. Let the mixture come to a boil and use the wet pastry brush to brush down the sides of the saucepan to dissolve any stuck-on sugar crystals. (Don’t forget to check the egg white mixture and turn off the mixer whenever necessary.) Clip the candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan (it’s OK if it’s coated in honey), reduce the heat to medium and boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan, until it registers 310 degrees, then remove from the heat immediately. With the mixer running on medium-high speed, stream the sugar mixture into the bowl just as you did the honey. Once you’ve added all of the sugar mixture, increase the speed to high and continue to beat until the sides of the bowl are warm but not hot and the mixture is very thick, dense and voluminous, about 4 minutes (the mixer might strain against the mixture).
Step 6
Finish the nougat: Turn off the mixer, add the melted coconut oil or cocoa butter and vanilla to the bowl, and beat on high just until the nougat is smooth. (The mixture will separate but then come back together, which is normal.) Turn off the mixer and remove the bowl. Remove the nuts from the oven and add to the bowl, then fold the nougat with a large flexible spatula until the nuts are evenly distributed. Scrape the nougat into the prepared pan and smooth the surface, working it into an even layer all the way to the sides and corners. Cover the nougat with a piece of parchment paper sprayed with more oil and smooth, then let it sit at room temperature until it’s completely set, at least 6 hours but preferably overnight.
Step 7
Cut the nougat: Uncover the nougat and use the parchment paper to lift it out of the pan and transfer it to a cutting board. Use a serrated or chef’s knife coated in vegetable oil spray to cut the slab into quarters in one direction, then slice each third crosswise into ½-inch pieces to make about 50 pieces.
Skinless pistachios are sometimes sold as “blanched.” They might not be available in typical grocery stores, but can be found at specialty grocers. You can also roast regular shelled pistachios, then simply rub off as much of the skins as you can with a kitchen towel.
The nougat, stored airtight at room temperature, will keep for up to 1 week.

Vegetable oil spray
1½
cups/360 grams heavy cream

Seeds scraped from ½ vanilla bean (pod reserved)
⅓
cup/34 grams whole coffee beans (optional)
2
cups/400 grams granulated sugar
¼
cup/85 grams light corn syrup
4
tablespoons/57 grams unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces
1
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)

Flaky salt, for finishing (optional)","221 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes, plus several hours’ cooling","Step 1
Prepare the pan: Lightly coat the inside of an 8-inch square pan with vegetable oil spray. Line the bottom and sides with parchment paper, smoothing to eliminate air bubbles, then lightly spray the parchment paper. Set the pan aside.
Step 2
Heat and infuse the cream: In a small saucepan, combine the cream, vanilla seeds and pod. Place the coffee beans, if using, inside a resealable bag and crush them with a rolling pin until they’re broken into bits. Add the coffee to the cream mixture. Bring the cream mixture to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting and keep the mixture warm while you make the caramel.
Step 3
Make the caramel: Fill a glass with water, place a pastry brush inside and set next to the stove. Combine the sugar, corn syrup and ⅓ cup/142 grams water in a large, heavy saucepan and stir gently with a heatproof spatula over medium-high heat to dissolve the sugar, about 3 minutes. Let the mixture come to a boil and use the wet pastry brush to brush down the sides of the saucepan and dissolve any stuck-on sugar crystals. Boil the mixture without stirring, occasionally swirling the saucepan gently and brushing down the sides of the saucepan if you see crystals forming, until the syrup takes on a pale golden color and the bubbles become large and slow to pop (a sign that the water had boiled off and caramelization is near), about 5 minutes. Turn the heat to medium and continue to cook, keeping a close watch and swirling the saucepan frequently, until the bubbling has mostly subsided and the mixture is very fluid and a deep amber color, 4 to 7 minutes.
Step 4
Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat and add the butter a few pieces at a time, stirring with a heatproof spatula (this will halt the cooking; be careful, the caramel will sputter). Gradually pour the cream mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into the saucepan with the caramel mixture and stir until the caramel is completely smooth. (Discard the solids in the strainer.) Stir in the kosher salt.
Step 5
Cook the caramel again: Return the saucepan to the heat and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan and cook, occasionally scraping the bottom and sides of the saucepan with the spatula, until the mixture reaches 250 degrees for softer caramels or 255 degrees for firmer caramels. Immediately remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the mixture into the prepared pan.
Step 6
Cool and cut the caramels: Allow the caramel mixture to cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, then sprinkle with flaky salt (if using). Let the caramels cool completely at room temperature, which will take several hours. Before cutting the caramels, refrigerate the pan for 15 minutes, then use the parchment paper to lift the slab out of the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Use a chef’s knife to cut the slab in quarters in one direction and in eighths in the other to make 32 bar-shaped caramels. Wrap them individually in parchment paper, waxed paper or foil candy wrappers.
The individually wrapped caramels, stored in an airtight container, preferably in the refrigerator, will keep for 1 week.

"Rice Krispie Treats","Bar Cookie,Brown Butter,Make Ahead,Marshmallow,Vanilla Extract,Easy,Quick,Snack,Dessert","Yield: 16 servings","½
cup/113 grams unsalted butter, preferably European-style, plus extra for greasing
1
(12-ounce/340-gram) bag marshmallows (preferably standard size)
1¼
teaspoons/5 grams kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1
teaspoon vanilla extract
6
cups/180 grams Rice Krispies cereal

Rainbow sprinkles (optional, but highly recommended)

Flaky salt (optional)","504 user ratings","20 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Butter a 9-inch square baking pan.
Step 2
In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat until it starts to foam, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue to cook, stirring constantly with a silicone spatula, until the bubbling stops and the little specks of milk solids begin to turn golden, another 2 to 3 minutes. Watch carefully at this stage; you want the milk solids to go from golden to a medium-dark brown, but not black.
Step 3
Immediately turn off the heat and add the marshmallows to the pot to stop the butter from cooking any further. Stir to coat all the marshmallows in the hot, browned butter until they’re well coated and begin to soften, about 1 minute.
Step 4
Return heat to low, add the salt and stir until the marshmallows are almost smooth (some small lumps are OK), 1 to 2 minutes more. Be patient at this stage; you want the marshmallows to melt evenly and gently, softening all the way through without reaching a boil. (If you apply too much heat, the sugars can caramelize and you could end up with harder Rice Krispies treats.) Turn off the heat. Stir in the vanilla. Add the cereal and, using a large silicone spatula, fold the mixture until all the cereal is coated.
Step 5
Pour into the prepared baking pan. Using the spatula, gently push and pull the cereal to spread out to fill the pan. (For the most delicate, fluffiest treats, avoid pressing down, as you don’t want to pack them in.)
Step 6
While still warm, top the treats with rainbow sprinkles and a very light sprinkle of flaky salt, if using. Let cool for at least 30 minutes to set before cutting.
Step 7
Once cool, remove from the pan and transfer to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, cut it into a 4-by-4 grid to get 16 squares. Treats keep best for up to 5 days, stored in an airtight container at room temperature. Enjoy!

For the Icing
2¼
cups/275 grams confectioners’ sugar
2
tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon (maybe a bit more) cranberry or pomegranate juice","1050 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling ","Step 1
Center a rack in the oven and heat it to 350 degrees.
Step 2
Prepare the cake: Butter a large (12- to 13-cup) Bundt pan, dust the interior with flour and tap out the excess, or coat the pan with nonstick baker’s spray.
Step 3
Whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda and then whisk in the cardamom, coriander and ginger; set aside.
Step 4
Put the granulated sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a large mixing bowl that will work with an electric mixer. Add the zest and, using your fingertips, rub it into the sugar until you catch a whiff of orange. Drop in the butter. Beat the sugar and butter together on medium-high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until pale, creamy and fluffy. Pour in the oil and beat for a couple of minutes more to blend it in well, turn off the mixer and scrape the bowl and beater(s).
Step 5
One by one, beat in the eggs, beating for a minute after each egg goes in. Beat in the vanilla — the mixture will look like frosting — then blend in the yogurt on low speed. Turn off the mixer, scrape the bowl and beater(s) well and add half the flour mixture. Working on low, mix until the dry ingredients are almost incorporated. Turn the mixer off, add the remaining flour mixture and, again, beat until almost blended. It’s fine if you can still see flour here and there. Working by hand with a flexible spatula, fold in the cranberries and any remaining flour. Scrape the batter into the pan and push it gently into the pan's curves, leveling the top as best as you can.
Step 6
Bake the cake for 55 to 60 minutes, until a tester inserted comes out clean. The cake will be deeply golden brown and pull away from the sides of the pan when prodded. Transfer the pan to a rack, let rest for 5 minutes and then unmold the cake onto the rack. Allow it to come to room temperature before icing.
Step 7
Make the icing: Put the confectioners’ sugar in a medium bowl and sprinkle over the juice. Stir the juice into the sugar. You’re aiming for an icing that flows easily off the side of a spoon. If needed, add more juice by droplets. Either keep the cake on the rack and slip a piece of parchment or a sheet pan under the rack to catch drips, or transfer the cake to a platter. Spoon the icing over the cake, allowing it to run down the sides. Let the icing dry before serving. Covered, the cake will keep at room temperature for at least 4 days. (If you haven't glazed the cake, it can be wrapped well and frozen for up to 2 months; defrost, still wrapped, at room temperature.)

ounces feta, crumbled (about ¾ cup)
½
cup Kalamata olives, pitted and halved","3067 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
In a large bowl, stir together the yogurt and garlic; season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer ½ cup of the yogurt to a medium bowl and reserve for Step 5.
Step 2
Coat the chicken: To the large bowl, add the oregano and stir to combine. Season the chicken all over with 1½ teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Add the chicken to the large bowl and turn to coat; set aside.
Step 3
Start the salad: Smash the cucumbers with the side of your knife until craggy and split. Rip into ½- to 1-inch pieces and transfer to a colander placed in the sink. Slice or chop the tomatoes into bite-size pieces. Add to the cucumbers along with 1 ½ teaspoons salt. (It may seem like a lot of salt, but most will drain away.) Toss to combine and leave to drain.
Step 4
In a large nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet, heat the olive oil over medium. Scrape excess marinade off the chicken, then cook the chicken in batches, adding oil to the pan if necessary, until it’s well browned and releases from the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, another 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to plates to rest. (For grilling info, see Tip.)
Step 5
To the medium bowl of yogurt, add the feta and mash with a fork until a chunky paste forms. Shake the cucumbers and tomatoes to get rid of any excess moisture. Add to the feta yogurt along with the olives and stir until coated. The balance is dependent on your produce and feta, so season to taste with salt and pepper until flavors are vivid. Eat alongside the chicken.
To grill the chicken: Heat a grill to medium and clean and grease the grates. Grill the chicken over direct heat until it's well browned and releases from the grates, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, another 5 to 7 minutes. (For a gas grill, close the lid between flips.)

ounce/20 grams shredded Parmesan (3 tablespoons), plus more for sprinkling
3
tablespoons snipped chives
1
teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped","276 user ratings","65 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Center a rack in the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8½- by 4½-inch loaf pan (glass or metal) or coat it with bakers’ spray. Line it with parchment paper, running the paper along the bottom and up the long sides of the pan. Leave extra paper on the long sides; they make good handles for removing the loaf from the pan.
Step 2
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper flakes.
Step 3
In another bowl, whisk together the eggs and egg white, the milk, olive oil and honey until well combined.
Step 4
In another bowl, fold together the mozzarella, fontina, ham, peppers, Parmesan, chives and thyme to combine, breaking up any cheese cubes that have stuck together.
Step 5
Pour the liquid ingredients over the flour mixture and, using a flexible spatula, stir a few times, just to get things started. Top with the cheese and ham mixture and, using as few strokes as possible, mix them in. Be gentle and don’t be too diligent — it’s better to have a few dryish spots than to overmix the batter. Scrape the batter into the pan, level the top and sprinkle with a little Parmesan.
Step 6
Bake for about 50 minutes if using a glass dish (you may need to bake it slightly longer if using metal), until the bread is golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Because of all the cheese, you could easily mistake a bit of cheese for a wet spot. If you’ve got an instant-read thermometer, you might want to test with it: the loaf should register 195 degrees. Transfer the pan to a rack and let sit for about 5 minutes before unmolding. Remove the paper and allow the loaf to come to room temperature on the rack. Wrapped well, the cake will keep for about 3 days at room temperature. It can be frozen for up to 1 month.

sheet store-bought puff pastry (any size), thawed (see Tip)
½
cup/100 grams granulated sugar
4
tablespoons/56 grams unsalted butter, melted
1
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or ½ teaspoon coarse kosher salt (such as Morton’s)
¾
cup/108 grams blanched almond flour (see Tip)
1
large egg
1
tablespoon dark rum or 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1½
teaspoons almond extract
½
cup/45 grams sliced almonds

Flaky salt, for topping

Confectioners’ sugar, for serving","1841 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Bake the puff pastry: Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 425 degrees. Unfold the sheet of puff pastry on a piece of parchment paper set in a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until puffed and brown, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and continue baking until dry, crisp and deeply browned, rotating the baking sheet once during baking, 20 to 30 minutes. (Once cooled, pastry can be covered and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days.)
Step 2
Make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the granulated sugar, butter and kosher salt. Stir together with a wooden spoon or stiff silicone spatula until evenly combined and creamy. Add the almond flour, egg, rum and almond extract; whisk until evenly combined. (Filling can be stored in an airtight container and refrigerated for up to 3 days.)
Step 3
When ready to assemble, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Using a long, sharp serrated knife, carefully slice the puff pastry horizontally, splitting it as you would a bagel. Flip the top of the pastry over, then spread about two-thirds of the almond filling evenly across the bottom of it, taking care to spread it all the way to the edges. Flip the top piece of pastry back onto the bottom piece, then evenly spread the remaining almond filling on top. Evenly distribute the sliced almonds on top, then lightly sprinkle with flaky salt. Bake until the nuts are toasted and the topping is brown, rotating the baking sheet once during baking, 20 to 25 minutes.
Step 4
Let cool slightly, then use the parchment to slide the pastry onto a cutting board. Dust generously with confectioners’ sugar, then slice into portions with a sharp knife. Serve warm or at room temperature.
The best way to thaw frozen puff pastry is to let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. However, if you’re in a hurry, you can thaw it on the counter until it unfolds easily but is still quite cold. If the pastry gets too warm and soft, pop it in the fridge to firm up before using.
Make sure to use blanched almond flour rather than the unblanched kind, which is made with natural almonds and includes their skins; unblanched almond flour will make the filling too stiff to spread properly.

fresh thyme sprigs, plus more picked leaves for garnish (optional)
2
cups fresh spinach leaves

Cooked jasmine rice, for serving","111 user ratings","About 3½ hours, plus overnight marinating","Step 1
Rub short ribs all over with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Place ribs in a large bowl and add the epis and toss to coat. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator overnight.
Step 2
Heat the oven to 250 degrees. Scrape the marinade off the beef, reserving it in the bowl. Pat the beef dry and transfer to a plate.
Step 3
Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high until it shimmers. Add the beef and brown the meat, turning it as needed, until it acquires a deep mahogany crust, about 10 minutes, reducing the heat if needed to avoid burning. Transfer the seared beef to a plate.
Step 4
Add the onion, carrot and garlic to the pot, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until they start to color and soften, about 3 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes longer, until the paste turns a shade darker.
Step 5
Stir in the tomatoes and their juices, scallions and habanero, along with the reserved beef marinade and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, to concentrate the flavors. The mixture will be thick. Reduce the heat, if necessary, to avoid splattering.
Step 6
Add the stock and thyme sprigs, followed by the seared beef and its accumulated juices. Bring to a simmer, stir to combine, then cover the pot and place it in the oven.
Step 7
Cook for 3 hours, until the meat pulls easily off the bone.
Step 8
Transfer the pot to the stovetop. Pick out the thyme sprigs, then skim and discard fat from the surface — there will be quite a bit. (If time permits, you could also cool to room temperature, refrigerate overnight, then scoop off the hardened fat at the top with ease. Reheat gently before serving.)
Step 9
To serve, stir in the spinach, 1 cup at a time, until it just wilts. Serve in a shallow bowl, with jasmine rice on the side, and garnish with thyme leaves, if desired.

tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed
1
(2-inch) piece ginger, thinly sliced and smashed, plus 1 teaspoon peeled and finely grated
1
tablespoon unsalted butter","309 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Coat the pork chops with 1 teaspoon brown sugar, and sprinkle generously with salt. In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons water, the remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar, whiskey and molasses. Season with salt.
Step 2
In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add the pork chops and cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until browned on the outside and the internal temperature in the thickest part is 110 to 120 degrees, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat if sugar is burning. If your chops have a fat cap, using tongs, stack both chops on top of each other, then grab both chops together and hold upright to sear the fat caps until crisp, about 1 minute.
Step 3
Lay the chops back down in a single layer and top with the sliced ginger. Add the butter, tilt the skillet and baste the pork by spooning the melting butter and drippings over the pork until the internal temperature registers 135 degrees, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer the pork and ginger to a plate to rest for at least 5 minutes. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat.
Step 4
Pour the molasses mixture into the skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium, standing back as it might sputter or flame. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the sauce resembles maple syrup and coats a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. It can be tempting to crank the heat, but don’t, or the sauce risks tightening or burning. If your sauce gets too thick, thin with water. Turn off heat and stir in the grated ginger.
Step 5
Discard the sliced ginger and stir resting juices into the sauce. Serve the pork chops with a spoonful of the sauce.
When shopping, look for unsulphured molasses. For this recipe, light molasses is too mild, and blackstrap is too bitter.

In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring butter and sugar to a boil, whisking, until thickened and smooth, about 3 minutes. The mixture may separate, and that is OK. Stir in vanilla and salt.
Step 3
Working quickly, pour mixture over crackers. Using an offset spatula, rubber spatula or even the back of a spoon, carefully spread caramel all over the crackers. (Try to keep the saltines all in one even layer.) Transfer baking sheet to oven and bake until bubbly, about 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool completely before topping, at least 15 minutes.
Step 4
Pour about 1 inch of water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. In a medium metal mixing bowl that fits on top of the saucepan, combine chocolate and oil. Place the bowl on top of the pan. (Be sure the water is not touching the bottom of the mixing bowl; if so, pour out some water.) Reduce heat to medium-low and allow the chocolate mixture to melt, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula. (Alternatively, combine chocolate and oil in a bowl and microwave in 30-second blasts, stirring in between, until melted and smooth, about 2 minutes total.)
Step 5
Pour melted chocolate on top of cooled crackers. Use an offset spatula to spread chocolate smoothly over the surface of the toffee. Immediately sprinkle the crushed candy canes on top and sprinkle with a little sea salt.
Step 6
Transfer baking sheet to refrigerator and chill for about an hour to set chocolate. Break saltine toffee into large pieces for storing and serving. Toffee will keep at room temperature in an airtight container for up to a week, after which it may get a little soft but still taste pretty good.
To crush candy canes, put them in a heavy-duty plastic bag, wrap the bag in a kitchen towel and hit the bag with a rolling pin or heavy can.

"Classic Philadelphia Fish House Punch","American,Cocktails,Punches,Brandy,Cognac,Lemon,Party,Plan Ahead,Rum,Sugar,Christmas,Hanukkah,New Year’s Day","Yield: 18 to 20 (4-ounce) drinks","4
lemons, peeled
¾
cup granulated sugar
1½
cups/12 ounces Jamaican rum
¾
cup/6 ounces Cognac or brandy
¼
cup/2 ounces peach brandy or a fruit eau de vie, such as apricot, apple or plum

Ice ring or block, for serving (see Tip)

Freshly grated nutmeg, for serving","90 user ratings","15 minutes, plus at least 3 hours’ chilling and resting","Step 1
Place the lemon peels in a medium bowl or a large jar, and reserve the lemons. Add the sugar and use a muddler or the end of a rolling pin to work the sugar into the peels until they start to turn slightly translucent, about 2 minutes. Set aside at room temperature for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Step 2
Juice the reserved lemons (you should have about ¾ cup juice) and add to the mixture. Stir (or cover and shake the jar) until the sugar dissolves. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the solids and transfer to a large bowl. (The mixture can also be stored in an airtight container, in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.)
Step 3
Add the rum, Cognac, peach brandy and 6 cups cold water; stir to combine. Pour into resealable bottles or jars, and cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to overnight.
Step 4
To serve, unmold the prepared ice ring and add to a punch bowl or serving bowl. Add the punch, then ladle into glasses and grate nutmeg on top of each.
At least one day (up to a few days) before you want to serve the punch, make the ice ring or block: Add enough distilled water to come halfway up the sides of a Bundt pan (silicone is best) or other mold that will fit into your punch bowl. Freeze overnight. You can also add decorations: Pour a few inches of distilled water into your chosen mold and layer in edible decorations of your choice: citrus slices, seasonal berries and fruit, fresh herbs, whole spices, edible flowers. (Remember that whatever you choose will eventually end up floating in the punch itself). Freeze for a few hours, then fill the mold with enough water to come halfway up the sides and freeze overnight. (This helps keep your decorations on the top of your final ice ring). If you’re having a hard time getting the ice out of the mold, dip the mold in hot water briefly or quickly run under hot water to help loosen.

"Caramel Cheddar Popcorn","Corn Syrup,Dark Brown Sugar,Make Ahead,Unsalted Butter,Easy,Quick,Snack,Christmas,Hanukkah","Yield: About 6 quarts (24 cups)","For the Caramel Popcorn

tablespoons unsalted butter
3
tablespoons corn syrup

For the Cheddar Popcorn
¾
cup Cheddar powder
1
tablespoon mustard powder
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
3
quarts popped unsalted popcorn (pick out any unpopped kernels)
3
tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more if needed","321 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 250 degrees, and line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.
Step 2
Make caramel popcorn: Place popcorn in a very large mixing bowl. In a medium pot, bring brown sugar, butter and corn syrup to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until butter and sugar have melted (the mixture should be foamy), about 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in salt and vanilla. Remove from heat, and stir in baking soda. (Mixture should bubble up.)
Step 3
Immediately pour hot syrup over the popcorn and use a spatula or large spoon to mix it well. Scrape popcorn onto the prepared baking sheets in one layer. Bake until crisp, rotating the pan and tossing popcorn after 15 minutes, 20 to 30 minutes total. To test for doneness, carefully remove a piece of the popcorn, let it cool for 30 seconds or so, then take a bite; if it’s crisp, it’s done. Set aside to cool.
Step 4
While the caramel popcorn is in the oven, prepare the Cheddar popcorn: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the Cheddar and mustard powders and salt.
Step 5
Place popcorn in a very large mixing bowl. Pour melted butter on top of popcorn and toss to combine. Sprinkle Cheddar mixture over popcorn and toss well using a rubber spatula. If the mixture looks dry, add a little more melted butter.
Step 6
Pour popcorn onto the second prepared baking sheet in one layer. Bake until dry, about 5 to 10 minutes, rotating the pan and tossing popcorn halfway through. Let cool completely.
Step 7
Combine Cheddar and caramel popcorn, or keep them separate, and pack them into tins, jars or bags.
Cheddar powder is available at spice stores, and online. To pop your own popcorn, heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. Add 3 kernels of popcorn and cover. When it pops, add another ⅓ cup popcorn kernels and reduce heat to medium-low. Partly cover the pot (leaving a crack open and away from you, or use a splatter screen to cover the pot; you want the steam to escape). Continue to cook until the popping stops. Transfer popcorn to a bowl and sprinkle with salt.

1
cup/230 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
1
cup/207 grams granulated sugar
1
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1 to 2
large egg yolks
2½
cups/320 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)
For Finishing
1
large egg white, beaten
½
cup decorative sugar","1202 user ratings","35 minutes, plus chilling and cooling","Step 1
Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Beat on low speed until incorporated and smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. (Do not beat until fluffy, you don’t need to incorporate air into the dough.) Add the egg yolk and mix until just combined. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Step 2
Add the flour to the bowl all at once and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer speed to low and beat until flour is fully incorporated, scraping the bowl again if needed, about 30 seconds. The dough will be in large crumbles.
Step 3
(If you’re starting with a half batch of Butter Shortbread Dough, start here.) Form the dough into two 9-inch logs. (If the dough is too crumbly to form into a log, mix in an additional egg yolk.) Wrap each log firmly in a strip of parchment paper and twist the ends shut. Refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to slice, about 30 minutes and up to 3 days.
Step 4
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 5
Brush the surface of each log all over with the egg white. Sprinkle a sheet of parchment paper with the decorative sugar and roll the log in the sugar to completely coat. Slice each log into ½-inch rounds. Lay the rounds on the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least ½ inch apart.
Step 6
Bake until the cookies are golden at the bottom edges, rotating once halfway through baking, 18 to 22 minutes. Move the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The baked cookies can also be stored frozen in an airtight container for up to 10 days. Thaw at room temperature before serving.
If using volume measurements, using a spoon, fluff and scoop the flour into a measuring cup, then scrape with a straight edge to level the surface. This will help prevent adding too much flour which can yield overly crumbly dough.

(If you’re starting with a half batch of Butter Shortbread Dough, start here.) Add the chopped chives and black pepper to the crumbled dough, and mix in using your fingers to incorporate. (If the dough feels too crumbly to come together, mix in an additional egg yolk before proceeding).
Step 4
Transfer the dough onto a sheet of parchment paper and pat into a 5- by 7-inch rectangle. Place another sheet of parchment over the top and roll the dough into an 8- by 11-inch rectangle. Peel off the parchment and scatter the grated Cheddar evenly over the top. Fold the dough in thirds similar to how you might trifold a letter: With the short edge running parallel to you, lift the right long side and fold it over until the right edge of the dough aligns with the center of the dough. Fold the left side over the top like you are closing a book. Press down lightly on the dough to adhere the fold. Slice the dough lengthwise, down the middle. You should have 2 strips at this point. Wrap the strips together in the sheet of parchment and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes and up to 3 days to chill completely.
Step 5
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Trim the edges of the chilled logs by shaving off any rounded sides. Slice each strip crosswise into ¼-inch slices. Lay the pieces on the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least ½ inch apart. Bake until the cookies are light golden brown at the bottom edges, rotating once halfway through baking, 13 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack and cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

cup/8 ounces tonic water

Lemon and orange slices, for serving

Ice ring or block, for serving (see Tip)","190 user ratings","20 minutes, plus at least 11 hours’ resting and chilling","Step 1
The day before serving, peel the lemons and oranges. Place the peels in a medium bowl or a large jar and reserve the fruit. Add the sugar and use a muddler or the end of a rolling pin to work the sugar into the peels until they start to turn slightly translucent, about 2 minutes. Set aside at room temperature for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Step 2
In a pitcher or large glass jar, add 3 tea bags or 3 teaspoons loose-leaf tea. Pour in 3 cups water, cover and refrigerate for 8 to 12 hours. Remove and discard the tea bags, if using, or strain out and discard the tea leaves through a fine-mesh sieve lined with cheesecloth. (Cold-brewed tea will keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.)
Step 3
Bring 1 cup water to a boil. Add the remaining 1 tea bag or 1 teaspoon loose-leaf tea. Steep for 4 to 5 minutes, then remove the tea bag or strain out the loose-leaf tea. Add the brewed tea to the citrus-sugar mixture and stir to dissolve the sugar. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the solids. Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. (The mixture can also be stored in an airtight container, in the refrigerator for up to 1 month.)
Step 4
When you are ready to serve, juice the reserved lemons and oranges (you should have about 1 cup juice, if needed, juice another lemon to get you to 1 cup). In a large punch or serving bowl, unmold the prepared ice wheel. Add the lemon and orange juice, reserved citrus-sugar-tea mixture, and the cold-brewed black tea. Pour in the soda water and tonic water, and stir gently to combine. Ladle into individual punch glasses and serve each with a lemon and orange slice.
At least one day (up to a few days) before you want to serve the punch, make the ice ring or block: Add enough distilled water to come halfway up the sides of a Bundt pan (silicone is best) or other mold that will fit into your punch bowl. Freeze overnight.

(This helps keep your decorations on the top of your final ice ring). If you’re having a hard time getting the ice out of the mold, dip the mold in hot water briefly or quickly run under hot water to help loosen.

Butter a 9-inch square metal baking pan and line the bottom and two sides with long strips of parchment, leaving a 1-inch of overhang and creasing the parchment to fit snugly into the pan.
Step 2
Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Beat on low speed until incorporated and smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. (Do not beat until fluffy, you don’t need to incorporate air into the dough.)

Step 4
(If you’re starting with a half batch of Butter Shortbread Dough, start here.) Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Add the ground cardamom and mix with your fingers to incorporate it into the dough. Remove 1 cup of the crumbled dough to a small bowl and refrigerate. Transfer the remaining dough to the buttered pan and flatten into an even layer by pressing into the pan using the flat bottom of a glass. Bake on the middle rack until the edges are golden brown and begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes. Cool in the pan slightly, for at least 15 minutes.
Step 5
Spread the fruit jam in an even layer over the surface of the crust. Zest the lemon right over the top of the jam, and sprinkle with the chopped nuts and reserved crumble. Return to the oven and bake, rotating once, until the top is golden brown and the jam is sizzling around the edges, about 35 minutes. Cool completely in the pan, at least 1½ hours. Run a knife along the edges to release the sides. Use the parchment to lift the cookie out of the pan onto a cutting board. Dust the top with confectioners' sugar. Cut the cookie into 4 strips, then cut each strip into six 1-inch wide bars.

Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Beat on low speed until incorporated and smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. (Do not beat until fluffy, you don’t need to incorporate air into the dough.) Add the yolk and mix until just combined. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Step 2
Add the flour to the bowl all at once and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer speed to low and beat until flour is fully incorporated, scraping the bowl again if needed, about 30 seconds. The dough will be in large crumbles.
Step 3
(If you’re starting with a half batch of Butter Shortbread Dough, start here.) Add a drop of the peppermint extract to the dough and mix in using your hands. (If the dough feels too crumbly to come together, mix in an additional egg yolk before proceeding). Turn the dough out onto a sheet of parchment paper and pat into a 5- by 7-inch rectangle. Place another sheet of parchment over the top and roll the dough into a ¼-inch-thick piece. Use a floured cookie cutter to stamp out the cookies, and transfer them to the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least ½ inch apart. You can push the dough scraps back together and reroll as many times as necessary. Bake until the cookies are light golden brown at the bottom edges, rotating the pan once halfway through baking, about 13 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.
Step 4
Prepare the marshmallow filling: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, honey, salt and ¼ cup water. Stir just to incorporate. Cook without stirring over medium-high until the sugar dissolves and the temperature of the syrup reaches 240 degrees, about 5 minutes. (Use an instant read thermometer or clip a candy thermometer to the pan to get an accurate reading.)
Step 5
Meanwhile, add ¼ cup water to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Sprinkle in the gelatin and gently stir with a spatula to moisten the grains. Allow the gelatin to hydrate, or bloom, about 3 minutes, while the sugar mixture cooks.
Step 6
When the sugar syrup reaches 240 degrees, and the gelatin in the bowl has bloomed, turn the mixer on low, and slowly add the sugar syrup in an even stream. Increase the speed to high and whip the mixture until the meringue is thick, holds its peaks, has doubled in volume and cooled to room temperature, 7 to 10 minutes. In the last minute of mixing, add the remaining drop of peppermint extract. Scoop the mixture into a piping bag, seal the top by twisting and set aside while you make the ganache.
Step 7
Make the ganache: Transfer the chocolate pieces to a small heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan, heat the cream gently over low heat until it just begins to steam, 4 to 5 minutes. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate pieces. Allow the chocolate and cream mixture to sit for 5 minutes. Stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the ganache is smooth.
Step 8
To assemble: Snip the end of the piping bag to create a small opening. Pipe peaked mounds of the peppermint marshmallow mixture on the top of each cookie. If the marshmallow is running off, allow it to cool another minute or two in the bag at room temperature.
Step 9
Dip each cookie, marshmallow top down into the chocolate until the marshmallow is completely coated. Once all the cookies have been dipped, decorate with the crushed candy canes. Allow the chocolate to cool completely and set. Keep the cooled cookies at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
If using volume measurements, using a spoon, fluff and scoop the flour into a measuring cup, then scrape with a straight edge to level the surface. This will help prevent adding too much flour which can yield overly crumbly dough.

¼
cup natural creamy peanut butter
1
tablespoon flaky salt, for finishing","640 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Beat on low speed until incorporated and smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. (Do not beat until fluffy, you don’t need to incorporate air into the dough.) Add the yolk and mix until just combined. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Step 2
Add the flour to the bowl all at once and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer speed to low and beat until flour is fully incorporated, scraping the bowl again if needed, about 30 seconds. The dough will be in large crumbles.
Step 3
(If you’re starting with a half batch of Butter Shortbread Dough, start here.) Crush the hard caramels: Place the unwrapped caramels in a freezer bag, wrap it in a kitchen towel, then hit the wrapped bag repeatedly with a rolling pin or the bottom of a wine bottle until the caramels are crushed into smaller pieces. You should end up with about ¾ cup crushed caramels.
Step 4
Add the crushed caramels to the dough crumbles and mix, using your fingers to incorporate into the dough. Stir in the peanut butter with a spatula until it’s streaked through the dough but not fully incorporated.
Step 5
Use a ½-ounce cookie scoop, an ice cream scoop or a tablespoon measure to portion the dough right onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least 1 inch apart. At this point you can refrigerate the scooped dough, well wrapped, for up to 3 days, or chill, then freeze in resealable plastic bags for up to one month. Bake until the cookies are light golden brown at the bottom edges, rotating once halfway through baking, 12 minutes. (If baking from frozen, you may need to add a minute or two to the baking time.) Sprinkle cookies with salt after removing from the oven.
If using volume measurements, using a spoon, fluff and scoop the flour into a measuring cup, then scrape with a straight edge to level the surface. This will help prevent adding too much flour which can yield overly crumbly dough.

cup/230 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
1
cup/205 grams granulated sugar
1
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1 to 2
large egg yolks
2½
cups/320 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)
For Finishing
3
tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1
tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1
tablespoon finely grated citrus zest (such as lemon, orange or lime)
1½
teaspoons ground ginger
2
tablespoons candied ginger, chopped (optional)","295 user ratings","1 hour, plus chilling","Step 1
Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar and salt. Beat on low speed until incorporated and smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. (Do not beat until fluffy, you don’t need to incorporate air into the dough.) Add the yolk and mix until just combined. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Step 2
Add the flour to the bowl all at once and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer speed to low and beat until flour is fully incorporated, scraping the bowl again if needed, about 30 seconds. The dough will be in large crumbles.
Step 3
(If you’re starting with a half batch of Butter Shortbread Dough, start here.) Divide the crumbled dough into two portions (if the dough feels too crumbly to come together, mix in an additional egg yolk before dividing). To one half, add the cocoa powder and mix into the dough until evenly incorporated using a rubber spatula or your fingers. Use your hands to spread the chocolate dough on a sheet of parchment paper into a 7- by 10-inch rectangle. To the second portion of the dough, add the toasted sesame oil, citrus zest, ground ginger and candied ginger, if using, and mix until evenly distributed. Place the spiced dough on top of the chocolate dough and use your hands to spread in an even layer until it reaches all sides of the bottom dough.
Step 4
Fold the dough in thirds similar to how you might trifold a letter: With the short edge running parallel to you, lift the right long side and fold it over until the right edge of the dough aligns with the center of the dough. Fold the left side over the top. Press down lightly on the dough to adhere the fold. Slice the dough lengthwise, down the middle, and stack the two halves on top of each other with the cut sides facing opposite directions. Press down again lightly to adhere. You should have what looks like a log at this point. Wrap the log in the sheet of parchment and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes and up to 3 days.
Step 5
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Trim the edges of the chilled log by shaving off any rounded sides. Slice the log in half lengthwise to make two strips. Further slice each strip crosswise into ½-inch rectangles. Lay the pieces on the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least ½ inch apart. Bake until the cookies are golden at the bottom edges, rotating once halfway through baking, about 22 minutes. Move the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The baked cookies can also be stored frozen in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Thaw at room temperature before serving.
If using volume measurements, using a spoon, fluff and scoop the flour into a measuring cup, then scrape with a straight edge to level the surface. This will help prevent adding too much flour which can yield overly crumbly dough.

cup plain yogurt
3
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for serving
2

½
teaspoon black pepper
2
pounds boneless lamb leg or shoulder, beef top loin or sirloin, or a combination, excess fat trimmed and meat cut into 1½- to 2-inch cubes

Lemon or lime wedges

Flat bread, such as pita, for serving

Grilled bell pepper and onion (optional), for serving

Fresh herbs, such as mint and basil (optional), for serving","66 user ratings","30 minutes, plus 5 to 24 hours’ marinating","Step 1
Place the yogurt, oil, garlic, tomato paste, salt, Aleppo pepper, paprika, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a medium bowl, and stir to combine well. Add the meat and toss to coat well in the marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.
Step 2
Take the meat out of the fridge 30 minutes prior to grilling. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes. Heat a gas grill to medium-high (400 degrees), or prepare a hot charcoal grill, and oil the grates. Remove the cubes of meat from the marinade and skewer them. Grill the meat, turning a few times, until cooked to your liking, 12 minutes (for medium-rare) to 15 minutes (for medium) on a gas grill, or 10 minutes (for medium-rare) to 12 minutes (for medium) on a charcoal grill. A little charring is OK, but turn them every couple of minutes so they don’t burn and will stay juicy on the inside. Skewer and grill the veggies alongside, if using. Just before serving, throw the bread on the grill to warm through.
Step 3
Place the bread on a serving dish, place the kebabs on the bread, squeeze a little lemon or lime juice over the kebabs, drizzle with a little olive oil, and an extra sprinkling of Aleppo pepper (if you like) and serve with fresh herbs.
The kebabs can be made in a broiler or on a stovetop, but they won’t achieve the same charred crust that they would on a grill. To broil: Place the kebab skewers on a foil-lined sheet pan and broil on high for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning a few times. Keep a close eye on the kebabs so they don’t burn. For stovetop: Heat an oiled grill pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high until hot. Place the kebabs on the skillet and cook, turning a few times, about 10 to 12 minutes total.

¾
cup/140 grams superfine (caster) sugar
1
tablespoon/10 grams potato starch
9
large egg whites (325 grams)
1
teaspoon cream of tartar

7
large egg yolks
½
cup/110 grams sunflower oil (or other neutral-tasting oil)

Grated zest of 4 large mandarin oranges (about 2 tablespoons)
¾
cup/170 grams fresh mandarin orange juice (see Tip)
1
tablespoon/10 grams fresh lime or lemon juice
1
teaspoon vanilla extract
½
teaspoon fine salt","524 user ratings","1 hour 5 minutes, plus at least 2 hours’ cooling","Step 1
Arrange one oven rack in the lower third of the oven and heat oven to 325 degrees.
Step 2
Have ready a 10-inch ungreased, unlined chiffon cake pan (a 2-piece tube pan).
Step 3
Make the meringue: Mix sugar with potato starch. In a clean bowl, whisk egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric stand or hand mixer on low speed, gradually increasing the speed to high, until the foam starts to pile up in floppy mounds. Gradually add sugar mixture while beating constantly, then beat until meringue is slightly glossy and stiff peaks just start to form. When you lift the whisk quickly and vertically out of the meringue, it should leave behind a pointed peak which curls over just slightly at the tip. Set meringue aside briefly while you proceed.
Step 4
Prepare the cake batter: Sift cake flour and baking powder into a large mixing bowl. Add sugar and whisk very well to thoroughly combine everything. Set aside.
Step 5
Whisk egg yolks, oil, orange zest and juice, lime juice, vanilla and salt together in another bowl until well blended. Scrape this mixture into the flour mixture and whisk gently just until batter is smooth.
Step 6
Briefly re-beat meringue for 10 seconds or so to redistribute any moisture which may have settled out. Add one-third of meringue to the cake batter and fold gently until almost blended. Add half of the remaining meringue to the batter and fold in likewise. Lastly, scrape the batter into the meringue mixing bowl and fold it into the remaining meringue until incorporated.
Step 7
Pour finished mixture gently into the pan. Bake on a low oven rack for 55 to 65 minutes. When the cake is done, a cake tester inserted into it midway between the pan side and the central tube will emerge damp but clean, with no gooey batter clinging to it.
Step 8
Remove the cake from the oven and immediately turn it upside down. Stand it on the cake pan’s feet, or, if the pan has no feet or if the cake has risen higher than the feet, balance the central column on a narrow jar or bottle neck. Let cake cool completely.
Step 9
To unmold, turn cake right side up, then run a long, thin, sharp knife around the cake’s edge and around the central tube. Lift tube and pan base insert out of the pan, and the cake with it. Run the knife around the base of the cake to free it from the insert, then invert it onto a serving plate and remove the insert. Slice cake with a very sharp plain or serrated knife to serve. Once fully cool, the cake can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 5 to 6 days. Well-wrapped individual slices can be frozen for up to 2 months.
Use only freshly-squeezed orange juice for this cake. Canned or bottled juice does not have the same freshness of flavor, and may be too acidic, which affects the cake’s texture. Mandarin orange juice and zest make this cake especially aromatic. You can use a combination of regular juice oranges and mandarin oranges.

1½
cups/165 grams confectioners’ sugar
2
tablespoons milk
1
teaspoon lemon juice

Pinch of kosher salt","401 user ratings","2½ hours plus overnight soak, time to cool and time to set","Step 1
Make the fruit mixture: The day before you bake the cake, combine the dried cherries, apricots, prunes, cranberries, currants, rum and orange juice in a medium bowl and fold thoroughly to combine. Cover the bowl tightly and let sit at room temperature until the fruit is soft and has absorbed all (or nearly all) of the liquid, stirring once or twice, 12 to 24 hours.
Step 2
Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Generously brush the inside of a 12-cup Bundt pan with butter. Dust the inside of the pan with several pinches of flour, then tap the pan on the counter at different angles to coat every buttered surface. Tap out the excess, then set the pan aside.
Step 3
Scatter the walnuts (or pecans) across a sheet tray and transfer to the oven. Toast until the walnuts are golden brown and fragrant, shaking the pan halfway through, 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool completely on the baking sheet, then chop the walnuts. Set aside.
Step 4
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, ginger, baking powder, allspice, baking soda and cloves. Set aside.
Step 5
In a large bowl, combine the butter, brown sugar, lemon zest and orange zest. Pinch off small pieces of the almond paste and add to the bowl. Using a hand mixer, beat the mixture on medium-low until combined, then increase the speed to medium-high and continue to beat, scraping down the sides once or twice, until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.
Step 6
With the mixer on low, add the eggs one at a time, increasing the speed just to incorporate each egg before decreasing to low and adding the next, until the mixture is very smooth. Beat in the vanilla, then, on low speed, add the flour mixture and mix just until it disappears. Tip in the fruit mixture, along with any unabsorbed liquid, along with the chopped nuts; use a flexible spatula to fold the batter several times, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl, until the fruit is evenly distributed.
Step 7
Scrape the batter into the prepared Bundt pan, distributing it evenly all the way around and taking care not to form large air pockets. Smooth the surface, then bake the cake until the surface is golden brown, risen and cracked, and a cake tester inserted into a crack comes out clean, 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 15 minutes.
Step 8
Use a skewer or toothpick to poke holes all over the surface of the cake. Use a pastry brush to generously soak the cake with about half of the rum. Let the cake absorb the rum for a few minutes, then turn it out onto a wire rack. Poke more holes all over the cake and dab the remaining rum across every surface.
Step 9
Warm the apricot preserves in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring often with a heatproof flexible spatula, just until the preserves are fluid. Pass the preserves through a fine mesh sieve into a small bowl, pressing on the solids with the spatula to extract as much of the liquid as possible (discard the solids, or scrape back into the jam jar). Use the pastry brush to paint the strained jam over the cake, covering every surface. Let the cake sit uncovered until it’s completely cooled and the jam is set (it should be slightly tacky but not wet to the touch).
Step 10
In a medium bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar, milk, lemon juice and a pinch of salt, and whisk slowly to combine, then whisk vigorously until you have a thick, smooth icing. Slowly pour the icing onto the tallest part of the cake all the way around, letting it slowly cascade down the side. Let the cake sit until the icing is completely set, about 1 hour.
The cake will keep, covered at room temperature, for 1 week.

Add the flour, yeast, sugar, eggs and 1½ teaspoons salt and mix on medium-low speed, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl as needed with a spatula, until the dough is smooth and sticky and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 8 minutes. Add a little more flour if the dough is very sticky.
Step 4
If you’re using a whisk, beat the sweet potato mixture in the bowl until the mixture is fairly smooth and no lumps remain. Add the flour, yeast, sugar, eggs and 1½ teaspoons salt and stir with a wooden spoon until the ingredients are well combined. Dump the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until it becomes smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes; it will be slightly sticky.
Step 5
Grease the inside of a large bowl with butter. Transfer the dough to the bowl. Cover and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free spot for about 1½ hours, or until it has more than doubled in size.
Step 6
Place the dough on a clean, ungreased surface and divide it into 15 equal pieces, each weighing about 65 grams. Working with one piece of dough at a time, cup each piece beneath your palm and work in quick, circular motions to form a tight ball, with only a tiny seam along the bottom.
Step 7
Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with more butter and arrange the dough balls in evenly spaced rows. Brush the balls with butter, loosely cover the pan and set aside in a warm place until the balls have turned puffy, doubled in size, and fill the pan, about 1 hour.
Step 8
About 15 minutes before the rolls are done rising, heat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the rolls until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer the pan to a wire rack. Brush the rolls gently with a little more butter.
Step 9
Let cool for 10 minutes, and then turn out the rolls onto the rack and invert again so they are bottom-side down. Let cool for about 20 minutes before serving.

½
cup/115 grams cold, unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes
½
cup chopped pitted kalamata olives
6
tablespoons/88 milliliters heavy cream","830 user ratings","45 minutes, plus chilling","Step 1
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt and rosemary. Zest the lemon into the bowl, add the butter and rub the pieces into the flour mixture using your fingers until small pebbles form. (Alternatively, use a food processor to pulse the dry ingredients with the butter.)
Step 2
Add the chopped olives, tossing to coat with the flour mixture. Pour the cream over the mixture, stir just until combined and squeeze until the dough comes together in a clump. Divide the dough in two equal 9-inch logs. Wrap each log firmly in a strip of parchment paper and twist the ends shut. Refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to slice, about 30 minutes and up to 3 days.
Step 3
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Slice each log into ½-inch rounds. Lay the rounds on the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least ½ inch apart.
Step 4
Bake until the cookies are golden at the bottom edges, about 22 minutes, rotating once halfway through baking. Move the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The baked cookies can also be stored frozen in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Thaw at room temperature before serving.

cups/383 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)
1
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1¼
cups/284 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
¾
cup/175 grams granulated sugar
1
large egg yolk
½
cup/76 grams roughly chopped candied orange peel
½
cup/76 grams shelled unsalted pistachios, roughly chopped
4
ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped","1601 user ratings","50 minutes plus 8 hours’ chilling","Step 1
Whisk together flour and salt in a medium bowl. Combine butter and sugar in a large bowl, or in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using an electric mixer (fitted with the paddle attachment if using a stand mixer), beat at medium-high speed until the mixture is pale in color, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula, as needed. Add egg yolk and blend until combined.
Step 2
Add flour mixture and mix on low until combined. If there are dried bits of flour left around the bowl, use a rubber spatula to incorporate. Add orange peel, pistachios and chopped chocolate and fold in with a rubber spatula. (The dough will be crumbly. If necessary, use the electric mixer to add the mix-ins, or work them in with your hands until fully incorporated.)
Step 3
To form the cookies, line an 8- by 8-inch baking pan with plastic wrap and leave a generous amount of overhang on all sides. Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and press very firmly to flatten in an even layer. Cover with plastic wrap and chill dough 8 hours or overnight before baking.
Step 4
To bake the cookies, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Step 5
Using the plastic wrap overhang, remove the dough from the pan and cut the square into three equal rectangles. Cut each rectangle crosswise into roughly ⅓-inch-thick slices (about 48 cookies total) and lay them flat on the prepared baking sheets, about ¾-inch apart. (If the dough crumbles when slicing, simply push the mixture together to reform the cookie.) Bake until lightly golden on the bottom but still blonde on the edges, 15 to 17 minutes.
Step 6
Remove from the oven, allow cookies to cool on the sheets. The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week.
If using volume measurements, using a spoon, fluff and scoop the flour into a measuring cup, then scrape with a straight edge to level. This will help prevent adding too much flour, which can yield overly crumbly dough.

cup/146 grams firmly packed dark brown sugar
¼
cup/90 grams honey
2
large eggs","69 user ratings","45 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
In a small saucepan, combine the dates with 1 cup water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Turn off the heat and let sit for 15 minutes. Strain the water from the dates, reserving the liquid. Add the dates to a food processor with the vanilla paste, 1 teaspoon of the salt and ¼ cup of the reserved date water. Process until smooth and the texture of a thick jam, adding 1 tablespoon of additional date water at a time if the mixture is too thick.
Step 2
Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with parchment paper so the paper hangs over the long sides of the pan. (This will make it easy to lift the bars out of the pan once they’re baked.) Spray the parchment with the cooking spray.
Step 3
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the butter, brown sugar and honey and mix on medium speed until well combined, about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides of the mixer with a spatula as needed. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, mixing until incorporated.
Step 4
Turn off the mixer and add the flour mixture. Mix on low speed until the flour is fully incorporated, scraping down the sides with a spatula as needed. The dough will be soft. Place half of the dough in the prepared pan and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Carefully spread the date mixture evenly over the top of the dough in the pan. Place the pan in the freezer for 30 minutes.

In a small bowl, stir together 1 tablespoon butter, the brown sugar and gochujang until smooth. Set aside for later, at room temperature.
Step 2
In a large bowl, by hand, whisk together the remaining 7 tablespoons butter, the granulated sugar, egg, salt, cinnamon and vanilla until smooth, about 1 minute. Switch to a flexible spatula and stir in the baking soda. Add the flour and gently stir to combine. Place this large bowl in the refrigerator until the dough is less sticky but still soft and pliable, 15 to 20 minutes.

While the dough is chilling, heat the oven to 350 degrees and line 2 large sheet pans with parchment.
Step 4
Remove the dough from the refrigerator. In 3 to 4 separately spaced out blobs, spoon the gochujang mixture over the cookie dough. Moving in long circular strokes, swirl the gochujang mixture into the cookie dough so you have streaks of orange-red rippled throughout the beige. Be sure not to overmix at this stage, as you want wide, distinct strips of gochujang.
Step 5
Use an ice cream scoop to plop out ¼-cup rounds spaced at least 3 inches apart on the sheet pans. (You should get 4 to 5 cookies per pan.) Bake until lightly golden at the edges and dry and set in the center, 11 to 13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. Let cool completely on the sheet pan; the cookies will flatten slightly and continue cooking as they cool. The cookies will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days.

¼
cup/50 grams granulated sugar
2
teaspoons espresso powder
½
teaspoon ground ginger","2480 user ratings","35 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling","Step 1
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium. When it begins to bubble and get foamy, remove from the heat and whisk in the espresso powder, fresh ginger, ground ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Scrape the butter mixture into a medium mixing bowl and set aside to cool for about 5 minutes.
Step 2
Add the sugars, molasses and salt to the bowl and whisk vigorously to combine. Add the egg, vanilla and baking soda and continue whisking until the mixture appears smooth and it’s the consistency of thin pancake batter, about 2 minutes. Add the flour and mix until evenly incorporated. Cover and chill the dough for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days before baking.
Step 3
Heat oven to 375 degrees, with racks on the lower and upper thirds. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Prepare the coating by combining the granulated sugar, espresso powder and ground ginger in a small bowl.
Step 4
Using a 2-tablespoon (1 ounce) scoop, scoop the dough and, using your hands, roll into walnut-size balls. (Alternatively, for each cookie, use a tablespoon measure to scoop 2 tablespoons dough and roll them into a ball.) Toss in the sugar mixture to coat.

1
cup/160 grams roughly chopped white chocolate, plus more to garnish

Flaky salt","398 user ratings","1 hour plus 12 hours’ chilling","Step 1
Add the granulated sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer (or large bowl if using a hand mixer). If using the vanilla bean, use a sharp paring knife to split it in half lengthwise. Use the back of the knife to scrape out the seeds and add them to the sugar.
Step 2
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter (with the vanilla pod, if using) and cook until foamy, swirling the pan occasionally. Whisk in the milk powder and cook until light golden brown, whisking constantly, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking, whisking constantly, until very deeply browned, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat, remove and discard the vanilla pod, if using, and with a stiff spatula, scrape the butter and all the solids into the bowl with the sugar.
Step 3
Stir to distribute the heat of the butter, then add vanilla extract, salt, baking powder, baking soda, almond extract and eggs. Mix with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed for 6 minutes, stopping once to scrape the bowl and whisk. (This dissolves some sugar and makes the cookies extra chewy.)
Step 4
Add the flour and mix with a stiff spatula until evenly combined into a dough. Add the nuts and chocolate to the dough and mix until combined.
Step 5
Divide the dough into ¼-cup (75 gram) portions using a #16 scoop, or a measuring cup. Roll the portions into balls, flatten them slightly into disks, and arrange on a parchment-lined quarter sheet pan or plate. Garnish each portion by pressing pieces of extra chocolate and nuts on top of the cookies. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 4 days. (Once chilled, the portions can be transferred to a resealable plastic bag and frozen.)
Step 6
When ready to bake, arrange a rack in the center of the oven and line a sheet pan with parchment. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Arrange 6 dough portions on the pan and lightly sprinkle each with flaky salt. Bake until puffed, cracked and golden along the edges, 13 to 15 minutes. (If baking frozen dough, increase the bake time by 2 minutes.)
Step 7
Using a spatula, transfer the cookies to a rack to cool. Repeat with remaining cookie dough. (No need to cool the sheet pan between batches.)
You can find milk powder in the baking aisle of the grocery store, alongside cans of evaporated milk.

Leftover slices and/or large chunks of roasted turkey
8 to 10
scallions, chopped into ¼-inch pieces

Sriracha, for serving","87 user ratings","6 hours","Step 1
Make the base stock: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Rub the chicken backs and necks with olive oil to coat. Season liberally with salt and pepper and arrange in a single layer on 2 sheet pans. (The pans’ rims will contain the rendered fat.) Roast for 40 minutes, until golden brown.
Step 2
Transfer the contents of both sheet pans — chicken pieces, rendered fat and crispy bits — into a 16-quart stock pot. Use a spatula to scrape up all the drippings. Pour in enough water to cover the chicken by 4 inches. Add the apple cider vinegar and bring to a heavy boil. Continue boiling over high for 2 hours or reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 hours, breaking up the chicken pieces intermittently with a wooden spoon, until the backs and necks are very soft, completely clean and broken apart. (Consider roasting the chicken the night before and then starting the boil the next morning if slow-simmering over low.)
Step 3
Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve, using a large wooden pestle or spoon to press out the fat from the meat, bone and cartilage. The solids should be almost dry when you are finished. Discard the solids and set the base stock aside; you should have 6 cups. (This stock can be made in advance and frozen.)
Step 4
Make the turkey stock: Take the turkey carcass and pick off the meat, using a knife or your hands. Refrigerate the picked or sliced meat. Separate the breast plate from the spinal column and remove the thigh and leg bones. The turkey carcass pieces do not need to be roasted again. If using additional chicken or turkey necks, roast them: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Coat the necks with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange in a single layer on a sheet pan. Roast until golden brown.
Step 5
Pour the base stock into a 16-quart stock pot. Submerge the turkey carcass pieces in the stock and add the additional roasted necks and drippings from the sheet pans (if using). If the stock does not cover all the pieces completely, add water until covered. Add 1 teaspoon salt and the apple cider vinegar and bring to a heavy boil. Continue boiling over high for 2 hours or reduce the heat to low and simmer for 12 hours, breaking up the turkey pieces intermittently with a wooden spoon. When finished, it should be opaque and have a silky viscosity that feels slippery on your tongue when you taste it.
Step 6
Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve, using a large wooden pestle or spoon to press out the fat from the remaining meat, bone and cartilage. Discard the pressed material. Taste the broth: It should be rich, smooth and salty. Add salt to taste if needed. Pour the broth back into the pot and keep over low heat.
Step 7
Make the ramen: In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium. Add the garlic and shallot and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the salt and pepper and continue cooking until the mushrooms begin to sweat, then add the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms start to absorb liquid again. Set aside.
Step 8
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the eggs into the pot. Leave uncovered. Set a timer for 6 minutes. Fill a bowl with an ice and water. When the timer goes off, transfer the eggs immediately to the ice bath and let sit for 2 minutes. Drain the eggs, then peel and set aside.
Step 9
Return the large saucepan of water to a boil and cook the ramen noodles according to package instructions. Drain and divide among 6 to 8 bowls. Add the sautéed mushrooms and reserved turkey meat to each bowl. Slice each boiled egg in half — the yolks should be slightly runny — and apportion two halves to each serving. Ladle the hot turkey broth over everything in each bowl. Sprinkle the scallions over the top and serve with soy sauce and sriracha on the table.
To save time, you can substitute 6 quarts of store-bought chicken stock for the base stock.

Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels. Season all over with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon chile powder (or a pinch of cayenne), and set aside.

"Apple Cider","Non Alcoholic Drinks,Apple,Snack,Fall,Halloween,Thanksgiving","Yield: About 1½ quarts","2½
pounds sweet apples, such as Honeycrisp, Fuji, Gala or Golden Delicious
2½
pounds tart apples, such as Pink Lady, Granny Smith, Gravenstein, Jonagold, Jonathan or Braeburn","18 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Line a colander or sieve with muslin or two layers of cheesecloth (allow for some overhang) and set over a large bowl or pot.
Step 2
When making your own apple cider, follow the same guidance you’d follow when eating raw fruit: Wash and dry apples thoroughly and remove moldy parts. If picking your own apples, do not use windfall or drop apples (i.e. apples from the ground). Core and coarsely chop the apples, leaving the peels on.
Step 3
Fill a blender or food processor halfway with apples, then add about ¼ cup water. Blend until the apples are coarsely mashed and juicy. (You can blend further, but your cider will be cloudier.) Add a little more water if the blender gets stuck. Transfer the puréed apples to the lined colander, gather the muslin around the puréed apples and twist. Squeeze and press to extract the apple cider. Open the muslin so it hangs over the colander and leave the puréed apple in the muslin.
Step 4
Repeat Step 3 with the remaining apples, and add to the apples already in the lined colander. Give it a good squeeze, then press it with a wooden spoon, meat mallet or heavy pot to extract as much juice as possible. If your apples aren’t giving up their juice, let them sit a few minutes before trying again. (If you would like to pasteurize your cider, heat it to 160 degrees for 1 minute, skim off any foam, then refrigerate. The flavor will be muted but the cider will still be delicious.)
Step 5
Drink warm, cold or at room temperature, and consider spiking or mulling it. Refrigerate for up to 5 days. Use the pomace (leftover pulp) to make apple butter, or add it to oatmeal, muesli, smoothies or quick breads.

1
garlic clove, minced

Fine sea salt
2½
tablespoons unsalted butter
⅛
teaspoon ground cinnamon","333 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
Step 2
Start with the topping: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and softened, about 6 minutes. Add the chestnuts, maple syrup, cinnamon, allspice, ⅛ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring all the while, until fragrant and glossy. Set aside to cool. Once the chestnuts are cooled, stir in the pomegranate seeds.
Step 3
Prepare the brussels sprouts: Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and add the brussels sprouts, 2 tablespoons oil, ¾ teaspoon salt and a generous grind of pepper; mix everything together. Spread the sprouts out and roast for 12 minutes. Add the kale and another ¼ teaspoon salt, stir to combine then return to the oven for another 10 to 12 minutes, until everything is nicely browned and cooked through. As soon as the brussels sprouts mixture is out of the oven, stir in the parsley, vinegar and maple syrup.
Step 4
While the brussels sprouts roast, add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to a small skillet and place over a medium heat. Once hot, add the sage leaves and cook for 2 to 4 minutes, stirring often, until deeply green. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the leaves to a plate lined with paper towels. Wipe out the pan, discarding the oil.
Step 5
Prepare the yogurt: Add the yogurt, garlic and ¼ teaspoon salt to a medium bowl and mix to combine. Spread out onto a large serving platter.
Step 6
Once the brussels sprouts mixture has been roasted and seasoned, make the browned butter: Add the butter and cinnamon to the small skillet and heat over medium. Once melted, cook for 3 to 4 minutes more, stirring occasionally, until nutty and nicely browned. Remove from the heat and let cool for 1 minute, then pour it over the yogurt. Spoon the brussels sprouts mixture all over the top, then top with the chestnut mixture and the fried sage leaves. Serve right away.

teaspoon black pepper
1
tablespoon neutral oil (such as grapeseed or canola)
2
small or 1 large Granny Smith or other tart-crisp apples, cored then sliced ¼ inch thick","496 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons water with the brown sugar, vinegar and miso; stir with a fork until smooth. Season the pork chops all over with salt, then the pepper. (Don’t skimp on the pepper; it’s an important element to balance the caramel.)
Step 2
Heat a large skillet over medium. Add the oil and the pork chops to the skillet. Cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until browned on the outside and the internal temperature in the thickest part is around 135 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes depending on thickness of pork chops. If your chops have a fat cap, using tongs, stack both chops on top of each other, then grab both chops together and hold upright to sear the fat caps until crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate to rest for 5 minutes. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.
Step 3
Add the apples to the skillet in a single layer and heat over medium. (Snack on any that don’t fit.) Cook without touching until browned underneath, 2 to 4 minutes. If the pan is smoking at any point, reduce heat. Pour in the brown sugar mixture and cook, scraping up browned bits and stirring, until thick enough to coat the back of the spoon, 1 to 3 minutes. (Keep your eye on the sauce toward the end so it doesn’t burn.)
Step 4
Turn off the heat, add the pork chops and their juices back to the skillet and turn to coat in the caramel. Serve the pork chops with a spoonful of the apples and caramel.

For the Phyllo Top

cup plus 2 tablespoons/5 ounces unsalted butter
16
phyllo pastry sheets, thawed","2102 user ratings","3 hours","Step 1
Set a rack in the middle of the oven and another right below it. Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Grease a 13-by-9-inch baking dish with butter; set aside.
Step 2
Prepare the cream: In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low. Add the shallots, garlic and black peppercorns and cook, stirring occasionally, until shallots are softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the half-and-half, bay leaves, thyme, nutmeg and 1½ teaspoons salt and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook, whisking occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.
Step 3
Strain the seasoned cream through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl. (You should have about 3 cups.) Return the cream to the saucepan off the heat. In the same bowl, whisk the egg yolks, then whisk in a few tablespoons of the warm cream, 1 tablespoon at a time, to temper the yolks. (Tempering prevents the cold yolks from scrambling when combined with the warm cream. The yolks will help your filling hold together.) Whisk the egg yolk mixture into the cream. Reserve and refrigerate 1 cup cream for serving. Rinse and dry the bowl.
Step 4
Using a mandoline (or very sharp knife; see Tip), slice the unpeeled red potatoes crosswise ⅛-inch thick. In the bowl, toss the potatoes with 1½ teaspoons salt and ¾ teaspoon pepper until evenly seasoned, then stir the potatoes into the cream in the saucepan. (The warmth of the cream will help the potatoes start to cook.) Set aside.
Step 5
Peel, trim and halve the beets, then slice them ⅛-inch thick using a mandoline (or very sharp knife; see Tip). Add the beets to the bowl and toss with ¾ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Shingle the sliced beets in the baking dish, overlapping slightly, in two even layers, then sprinkle them evenly with 1⅓ cups grated Gruyère. Wipe out the bowl to remove any beet juices.
Step 6
In the bowl, season the sliced sweet potatoes with 1 teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Shingle them on top of the cheese-topped beets in 2 to 3 even layers, then press them gently to compress the vegetables evenly, eliminating any air pockets. Sprinkle the sweet potatoes with 1⅓ cups grated Gruyère.
Step 7
In the bowl, season the squash with ¾ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Shingle the squash over the cheese-topped sweet potatoes in 2 even layers, press to compress the mixture, then sprinkle the squash with the remaining 1⅓ cups grated Gruyère.
Step 8
Shingle the potatoes on top in 2 to 3 even layers, then slowly pour the remaining cream mixture evenly over the sliced vegetables. Set on the middle rack of the oven and place a large sheet pan directly underneath on the rack below to catch any drips. Bake until the vegetables start to soften, about 1 hour.
Step 9
After the vegetables have baked for about 40 minutes, prepare the phyllo: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Working on a large, clean surface, set 1 sheet of phyllo down. Brush lightly with melted butter then set a second sheet of phyllo on top. Take your hands and scrunch the phyllo into a 5½-inch rosette with lots of folds. Push aside, then repeat with remaining 14 sheets of phyllo, creating 8 rosettes total.
Step 10
After the sliced vegetables have cooked for 1 hour, remove from the oven. Increase heat to 400 degrees. Using a paper towel, gently pat the surface to remove any liquid that may have risen to the surface, then cover the top with the 8 phyllo rosettes, scrunching them as needed to fit. Brush the phyllo generously with melted butter.
Step 11
Bake until the phyllo is crisp and golden and the vegetables are tender and a paring knife slides easily through the center, about 30 minutes. Let cool for 20 to 30 minutes before slicing. (Patience is crucial; if you slice this before the liquids are reabsorbed, the gratin won’t form slices without slipping apart.)
Step 12
While the gratin firms up, reheat the reserved cream over medium until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season the warm sauce with salt and pepper.
Step 13
To serve, cut the gratin in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise to form 12 even slices. Pass the sauce at the table, to spoon on the side.
In order for the vegetables to be tender by the time the phyllo is crispy and golden, they must be sliced ⅛-inch thick. A mandoline makes fast work of vegetable slicing and creates uniformly thin pieces, though you could use a very sharp knife (and an abundance of caution) when slicing the dense vegetables. Japanese Benriner slicers are restaurant staples, and are affordable tools for home cooks, too.

"Pumpkin-Butterscotch Custard With Spiced Whipped Cream","Custards And Puddings,Dark Brown Sugar,Egg Yolk,Heavy Cream,Make Ahead,Party,Plan Ahead,Pumpkin Puree,Pumpkin Spice,Dessert,Fall,Thanksgiving","Yield: 8 to 10 servings","For the Custard
1
cup/210 grams packed dark brown sugar
1
tablespoon/14 grams unsalted butter
1½
cups/355 milliliters heavy cream
1½
cups/355 milliliters whole milk
5
large eggs
4
large egg yolks
½
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
1
cup/250 grams pumpkin purée or solid pack pumpkin
2
teaspoons vanilla extract or bourbon
½
teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
For the Topping
2
cups/473 milliliters heavy cream, cold
⅓
cup/35 grams confectioners’ sugar
½
teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, plus more to taste","383 user ratings","1 hour, plus at least 6 hours’ cooling and chilling","Step 1
Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Place a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan on the center rack.
Step 2
In a medium saucepan, melt brown sugar and butter over medium-high heat, stirring, until sugar is melted, about 3 to 7 minutes. (Lower the heat if the sugar starts to burn.) Remove from heat and pour in a big splash of cream. The melted sugar will bubble up; wait for it to settle a bit, then stir to combine the caramel and cream. It may seize up into bits of hard candy-like caramel, and that is OK. Return the pan to medium-low heat, add remaining cream and milk and, whisking occasionally, let simmer until all the hard caramel bits are melted, 7 to 12 minutes.
Step 3
In a large heatproof bowl, whisk together eggs, yolks and salt. Pour a splash of the hot caramel mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly, then slowly pour in remaining caramel mixture. Whisk in pumpkin, bourbon or vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice.
Step 4
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a shallow 2-quart ceramic casserole or baking dish, or 9-by-12-inch or 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish (don’t use metal). Cover loosely with aluminum foil and place on the rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan in the oven. Add hot tap water to the baking sheet or roasting pan until it comes a third of the way up the side of the custard dish.
Step 5
Bake the custard until the edges are just set but the center is still jiggly (the center will firm up as it cools), 50 to 65 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, remove foil and let cool for at least 1 hour. Cover the custard dish and chill until cold, at least 4 hours or up to 3 days.
Step 6
Make the topping: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk, beat the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar and pumpkin pie spice until soft peaks form.
Step 7
To serve, heap the whipped cream onto the custard and sprinkle with more pumpkin pie spice, if you like.

pounds russet potatoes (about 6 medium-large), scrubbed
6
tablespoons unsalted butter
6
garlic cloves, smashed and peeled

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

Pinch of ground nutmeg
½
cup crème fraîche or sour cream, at room temperature
1
tablespoon finely chopped chives","1004 user ratings","2 hours 15 minutes","Step 1
Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Bake the potatoes directly on the oven rack until the flesh is soft and tender and the skins are crispy, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them sit at room temperature just until they’re cool enough to handle (they should still be hot). Lower the oven temperature to 400 degrees.
Step 2
Meanwhile, heat a 10-inch nonstick, oven-safe skillet over medium. Add the butter and swirl the skillet until the butter is melted and foamy, then add the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until both the garlic and butter are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.
Step 3
Cut the still-hot potatoes in half and scoop the flesh out onto a cutting board (save the skins for snacking or discard). Use a knife or bench scraper to chop up the flesh so you have pieces of various sizes but none larger than a walnut half.
Step 4
Add the potato flesh to the skillet, season generously with salt and pepper and add a pinch of nutmeg. Add the crème fraîche or sour cream, and fold the mixture gently until the potatoes are evenly coated, then flatten it gently into a single layer. Place the skillet over medium-high heat and cook undisturbed until all of the moisture has evaporated and the potatoes are starting to turn golden on the bottom, 5 to 8 minutes.
Step 5
Gently shake the skillet to loosen the potato cake, then transfer it to the oven and bake until the potatoes are lightly browned across the surface, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the skillet and let sit for 10 minutes, then carefully invert the potato cake onto a serving platter (if making ahead, see note below). Top with chives and serve.
DO AHEAD: The potato cake can be made several hours in advance. Leave it in the skillet and set aside at room temperature, then reheat in the oven at 425 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, toast the coconut flakes, stirring constantly, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Add the oil to the pan and heat over medium. Add the peanuts and toast, stirring constantly until fragrant and golden brown, 5 minutes.

Step 3
Cut off the tops and bottoms of the grapefruits with a sharp knife, so each fruit sits flat on your work surface. Slice off the rest of the peels in strips, cutting down the length of the fruit and carefully removing the white pith as you go. Over a large bowl, use your fingers to pull the citrus flesh off the membrane in large pieces. You can also use your knife to slice the flesh off the membrane. Discard the membrane and transfer the flesh to a large bowl. You should have about 5 cups fruit flesh with some juice in the bowl.

To the bowl of citrus, add half of the cilantro, all the basil leaves and the dried shrimp, if using. Pour in ¼ cup dressing and toss gently to combine. Add the coconut and peanut mixture, and toss with a couple more tablespoons of the dressing. Divide the salad among bowls, or transfer to a serving platter.

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1
teaspoon vegetable stock concentrate (such as Better Than Bouillon), optional
2
cups pomegranate juice","233 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 425 degrees and set a rack closest to the broiler.
Step 2
Prepare the mushrooms: In a small bowl, stir together the poultry seasoning, granulated onion, salt and pepper. Lightly brush 2 large sheet pans with olive oil to coat. Divide the mushrooms among sheet pans. Drizzle each batch with 2 tablespoons olive oil, then gently toss to coat. Sprinkle the mushrooms evenly with the spice blend and toss to coat again. Tuck the rosemary sprigs among the mushrooms, wrap tightly with aluminum foil and set both sheet pans in the oven to tenderize the mushrooms, about 25 minutes.
Step 3
While the mushrooms steam, prepare the pomegranate sauce: In a medium saucepan, heat the butter over medium until melted. Stir in the shallot, chile, garlic and peppercorns. Season with ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the stock concentrate (if using), then pour in the pomegranate juice and cook over medium-high, whisking occasionally, until the liquid is the consistency of maple syrup and thick enough to coat a spoon, 15 to 20 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pushing on the solids to extract any liquid. You should have about ½ cup sauce, which will keep, refrigerated, for up to 2 days.
Step 4
After the mushrooms have steamed, heat the broiler to high. Pull the mushrooms from the oven and remove the foil. Working with 1 sheet pan at a time, return the mushrooms to the rack nearest the broiler and cook, uncovered, until browned and caramelized at the edges, 4 to 6 minutes.
Step 5
Discard rosemary and season mushrooms to taste. Arrange the mushrooms on a serving platter. Drizzle lightly with pomegranate sauce, passing the remaining sauce at the table.
You also can use a mix of mushrooms that total 3 pounds and are prepared so they’re all about the same size. If using fresh shiitakes, stem and halve them. If using creminis, trim and quarter them.

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1
garlic clove, halved
3
pounds fingerling potatoes, scrubbed
3
fresh thyme sprigs
4
cups chicken or turkey stock, preferably homemade","507 user ratings","About 3 hours","Step 1
Heat 3 tablespoons butter in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. When the butter is melted and foamy, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring often, until the onions are golden brown, adding a splash of water to the skillet as needed if the bottom is getting brown, 25 to 30 minutes longer. Season the onion with salt and pepper, and scrape into a medium bowl. Set the bowl aside and reserve the skillet.
Step 2
Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Rub the bottom and sides of a 3-quart baking dish with the cut sides of the garlic clove, then generously coat with room temperature butter. Set the baking dish aside.
Step 3
Using a mandoline or a knife and a cutting board, slice about a third of the potatoes into ⅛-inch-thick rounds. Working quickly so the potatoes don’t brown, heat 1 tablespoon butter in the reserved skillet over medium-high, then add the sliced potatoes and 1 thyme sprig; toss until the potato slices are coated in the butter. Season lightly with salt and pepper, then continue to cook, tossing occasionally, until the potatoes are browned in spots and just starting to turn translucent and lose some of their crunchy texture, about 5 minutes. Scrape the potato mixture into a separate large bowl.
Step 4
Working in two batches, slice the remaining potatoes and cook with the remaining butter and thyme in the skillet just as you did the first batch. Transfer all of the potatoes to the same bowl as the first batch and let cool for a few minutes (reserve the skillet).
Step 5
Scatter about a third of the potato slices in an even layer on the bottom of the prepared baking dish, then scatter about half of the onions over top. (You can pluck out and discard the thyme sprigs if you like, or, if you don’t mind picking them out later, you can leave them in.) Scatter half of the remaining potatoes in the baking dish, then top with the remaining onions. Layer the remaining potatoes over top in an even layer, shingling them or arranging in a rosette, or you can leave them haphazard.
Step 6
Add the stock to the reserved skillet and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. If using homemade stock, give it a taste and add salt as needed to make sure it’s well seasoned (store-bought stock is usually already pretty salty). Remove the skillet from the heat and gently pour the stock into the baking dish just until it barely covers the potato slices. If you have any stock leftover, reserve it for moistening the potatoes as needed while they bake.
Step 7
Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake uncovered until the potatoes are tender and golden across the surface and the stock is bubbling, reduced and has been mostly absorbed by the potatoes, 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 40 minutes. If the surface of the potatoes seems to be drying out or if the potatoes absorb all of the stock during baking, drizzle some of the reserved stock over top to moisten them. (If you don’t have any more stock, you can use water.)
Step 8
Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them cool completely at room temperature (turn off the oven). As it cools, the mixture will set and absorb the stock, but if you are using store-bought stock, it will stay a bit brothy. The potatoes can sit uncovered at room temperature for several hours.
Step 9
About an hour before serving, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Transfer the baking dish to the oven and bake uncovered until the potatoes are heated through, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.
DO AHEAD: The pommes boulangère can be assembled and submerged in stock up to 24 hours ahead. Cover the baking dish and refrigerate, then let it come up to room temperature before baking. Note that it will take longer to bake since the stock will be room temperature rather than warm.

Heat the oven to 425 degrees and set a large sheet pan in the oven.
Step 2
In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil with 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt and ¾ teaspoon pepper.
Step 3
Add the brussels sprouts to the dressing and toss to coat. (Be sure to add any precious outer leaves that fell off during slicing; they’ll crisp up in the oven and add tons of texture.)
Step 4
Add the brussels sprouts to the hot sheet pan (you should hear a satisfying sizzle), push them around into an even layer and bake them until tender and charred in spots, about 25 minutes.
Step 5
While the brussels sprouts roast, prepare the chile garnish: Combine the chile and remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar in a small bowl and set aside. (The vinegar’s acidity will tame the chile’s heat.)
Step 6
Once the brussels sprouts have roasted, season to taste with salt and pepper. (You may be surprised how much seasoning they need.)
Step 7
Transfer the brussels sprouts to a serving platter or bowl. Drizzle with 1 to 2 tablespoons honey. Finely grate the zest of the orange over the brussels sprouts, then quarter the orange and squeeze one portion over the sprouts. Top with the nuts and, using a fork, distribute the chiles on top (discarding the vinegar or saving it for another use). Enjoy hot or at room temperature.
If you can’t find smoked almonds, toast ¼ cup coarsely chopped walnuts, pecans, plain almonds, macadamia nuts or pine nuts in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and toss with ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika; season with salt and pepper and let cool before garnishing.

medium head green cabbage (about 2½ to 2¾ pounds)
½
cup extra-virgin olive oil
1
teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice
2
tablespoons coarse mustard
1
tablespoon honey
2
large garlic cloves, finely grated (2 teaspoons)

For the Dressing
½
cup crème fraîche or sour cream
¼
cup mayonnaise
1
lemon, zested plus 2 tablespoons lemon juice

Kosher salt and black pepper

Torn fresh dill and parsley, for garnish","386 user ratings","45 minutes, plus overnight chilling","Step 1
Heat oven to 450 degrees.
Step 2
Prepare the cabbage: Peel any wilted outer leaves, then halve the cabbage lengthwise through the core, setting both halves flat on your cutting board. Slice them through the core into 12 even wedges (each about 1¼ inches thick at the widest point). Gently transfer them to a large sheet pan, carefully keeping each wedge intact.
Step 3
In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon zest and juice, mustard, honey, garlic, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Brush half the vinaigrette over the cabbage wedges, making sure it drips between the leaves, then carefully flip the wedges over and brush with the remaining vinaigrette.
Step 4
Roast the cabbage until tender, golden at the edges and caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes.
Step 5
While the cabbage roasts, prepare the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the crème fraîche, mayonnaise, lemon zest and juice; season to taste with salt and pepper. (If using sour cream, thin the dressing with just enough water so that it can be drizzled, about 1 tablespoon.) Refrigerate for up to 2 days.
Step 6
Let the cabbage cool, then refrigerate it for up to 2 days. Arrange the cabbage wedges on a serving platter. Season to taste. Serve cold or at room temperature, drizzled with the dressing (brought to room temperature) and garnished with the dill and parsley.

"Duchess-Style Twice-Baked Potatoes","Vegetables,Egg Yolk,Make Ahead,Milk,Russet Potato,Side Dish,Vegetarian,Thanksgiving","Yield: 8 servings","6
medium russet potatoes (about 3 pounds), scrubbed
¾
cup whole milk
½
cup unsalted butter
⅛
teaspoon ground nutmeg

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4
large egg yolks, at room temperature

Sweet paprika, for topping","167 user ratings","About 2 hours","Step 1
Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Bake the potatoes directly on the oven rack until the flesh is soft and tender and the skins are crispy, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Remove the potatoes from the oven and let them sit at room temperature just until they’re cool enough to handle (they should still be hot). Leave the oven on.
Step 2
Meanwhile, combine the milk and butter in a large saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting just to keep the mixture warm. (It should not be bubbling.)
Step 3
Cut 2 of the still-hot potatoes in half lengthwise and carefully scoop the flesh into a food mill, ricer or drum sieve, taking care to keep the skins intact. Set the skins aside, then mill, rice or press the flesh into the saucepan. Repeat with the remaining potatoes in 2 more batches, reserving 8 skins total (you can snack on or discard the 4 other skins).
Step 4
Add the nutmeg to the saucepan and generously season the potato mixture with salt and pepper. Remove the saucepan from the heat and gently fold until the mixture is smooth, then taste and adjust the seasoning. Gently stir in the egg yolks until combined. Set the saucepan aside and let the potato mixture cool completely to room temperature, stirring occasionally.
Step 5
Place the 8 potato skins on a rimmed baking sheet, spacing them evenly. For a fancy (but optional) look, scrape the potato mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large open star tip and pipe the mixture into the skins, dividing evenly and using all of the mixture so that each skin is mounded with filling. Alternatively, spoon the potato mixture into the skins and smooth the tops.
Step 6
Lightly dust the top of each potato with paprika, then transfer to the oven and bake until the surfaces are lightly browned in spots, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a platter and serve.
DO AHEAD: The potato skins can be filled up to 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before topping with paprika and baking again. They will take a few minutes longer to heat through and brown in the oven.

1
tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves

Grated zest of 1 lemon

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1
(12- to 14-pound) fresh turkey
1
large yellow onion, unpeeled and cut in eighths
1
lemon, quartered
8
sprigs fresh thyme

tablespoons (¾ stick) unsalted butter

large red onion, halved and sliced ¼-inch thick
4
large garlic cloves, peeled and halved
6
tablespoons all-purpose flour
4
cups good chicken stock
2
tablespoons Cognac or brandy
10
large fresh sage leaves
2
bay leaves

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1
cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio","459 user ratings","5 hours, plus 2 to 3 days’ brining","Step 1
Brine the turkey: 2 or 3 days before you plan to roast the turkey, combine the thyme, lemon zest and 3 tablespoons salt. Wash the turkey inside and out, drain it well and pat it all over with paper towels. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the salt mixture in the cavity of the turkey and rub the rest on the skin, including under the wings and legs. Place the turkey in a shallow dish just large enough to hold it and wrap it tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 or 2 days. The day before you plan to roast the turkey, remove the plastic wrap and leave the turkey in the fridge. The skin will dry out and turn a little translucent.
Step 2
Prepare the turkey: Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Put the turkey in a large roasting pan, discarding any juices in the dish. Place the onion, lemon and thyme sprigs in the cavity. With kitchen string, tie the legs together and the wings close to the body. Brush the turkey with the butter and sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper.
Step 3
Roast the turkey for 2 to 2¼ hours, until the breast meat registers 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer (put the thermometer in sideways). Remove from the oven and place the turkey on a platter. Cut off the legs and thighs and put them back into the roasting pan, covering the breast and carcass tightly with aluminum foil. Place the roasting pan back in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dark meat registers 180 degrees. Remove the dark meat to the platter with the turkey, cover it tightly with aluminum foil, and allow it to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.
Step 4
While the turkey is roasting, make the gravy base: Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and sauté, stirring often, for 15 to 20 minutes, until the onion becomes browned and starts to caramelize. Sprinkle on the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1½ minutes. Stir in the chicken stock, Cognac, sage leaves, bay leaves, 2 teaspoons salt (or more or less, depending on the saltiness of the chicken stock) and 1 teaspoon pepper. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour, then strain, pressing the solids lightly and then discarding them. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Step 5
While the turkey rests, finish the gravy: Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat and add the wine. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring and scraping up all the bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. Slowly whisk the gravy base into the pan. Simmer for about 5 minutes, until the gravy is smooth and slightly thickened. Taste for seasoning.
Step 6
Pour a ¼-inch layer of the gravy into a large (12- by 16-inch), ovenproof serving platter (make sure it’s ovenproof!). Carve the turkey and arrange it artfully on top of the gravy. Cover the platter and set it aside for up to 2 hours, until ready to serve. Uncover the platter and place it in the 325 degree oven for 15 to 30 minutes, until the turkey is very hot. Serve hot with extra hot gravy on the side.

"Refried White Beans With Chile-Fried Eggs","Beans,Egg,Red Pepper Flake,White Bean,Breakfast,Dinner,Easy,Quick,Weeknight,Main Course,Vegetarian","Yield: 4 servings","For the Refried Beans
¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil
1
medium yellow onion, finely chopped

Salt and pepper
2
(15-ounce) cans white beans, such as cannellini or navy
For the Chile-fried Eggs
3
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
4
large eggs

Large pinch of red-pepper flakes

Salt

Sherry or red or white wine vinegar, or lemon juice, to taste","692 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
To make the refried beans: In a large (12-inch) nonstick or cast-iron skillet, or a large pot (you’ll need a large skillet for the eggs, so use a pot here if you only have one skillet), heat the oil over medium-high. Add the onion, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and browned in spots, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the beans and their liquid, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has thickened and resembles gravy, 3 to 5 minutes.
Step 2
Turn off the heat. Use a potato masher (or the back of a wooden spoon, if using a nonstick skillet) to mash the beans until only a few whole beans remain. Stir to combine. The beans will thicken as they sit, so if they’re already thick, add water to thin. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm while you fry the eggs.
Step 3
To make the fried eggs: In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high until it ripples like the ocean, 2 to 3 minutes. Crack the eggs into the pan. (To minimize splatters and spreading, open the shell near the oil, not from high up, and slowly let the egg pour out of the shell.) Leave the eggs untouched until the edges are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.
Step 4
Turn off the heat. Sprinkle the eggs with red-pepper flakes. Gently tilt the pan toward you, spoon up some of the oil to baste the whites and edges of the yolk until the whites are set, about 1 minute. (Avoid the yolk, so that it stays runny).
Step 5
Divide the beans among plates or bowls, then top each with an egg. Season the eggs with salt, then add a few drops of vinegar onto each egg.
To use home-cooked beans, use 3 cups cooked beans and 1 cup bean liquid and cook longer. Add bean liquid as needed to adjust consistency.

¼
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
1
cup/125 grams all-purpose flour

Confectioners’ sugar, for serving (optional)","353 user ratings","1 hour 30 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Prepare the pears: Pour the wine into a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat. Let simmer until it reduces by half, 5 to 8 minutes.
Step 2
Add the pears, butter and sugar (use less sugar if your pears are very sweet). Let simmer until the pears absorb the wine and caramelize, 7 to 10 minutes. All the liquid should be gone. Spoon pears into a bowl and let cool while you prepare the cake batter.
Step 3
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the cake: Butter an 8- or 9-inch springform pan. Using an electric mixer fitted with the paddle, or a bowl and wooden spoon, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, 2 to 6 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add the baking powder, cardamom, citrus zest and salt, and beat until smooth. Beat in flour until well combined.
Step 4
Scrape batter into the pan and smooth the top. Lay the pear slices on top of the cake. Bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour (the 9-inch pan bakes faster than the 8-inch). The top should be light golden, and the crumb should spring back when lightly pressed with a finger.
Step 5
Serve warm or at room temperature, topped with a little confectioners’ sugar, if you like. Cake will keep in the refrigerator for 24 hours; bring to room temperature before serving.

ounces/113 grams bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
2
tablespoons hot brewed coffee or hot water
2
teaspoons light corn syrup
¼
cup/40 grams roasted, salted peanuts","487 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Make the crust: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Mix the crumbs, cocoa powder, confectioners’ sugar and salt in a medium bowl until well combined. Drizzle the butter over and mix with a fork or your fingers until the mixture is evenly moistened.
Step 2
Coat a standard 9-inch pie plate with nonstick cooking spray. Spread the crumb mixture in an even layer across the bottom. Press the crumbs firmly into the bottom and up the sides to form a crust. Bake until it feels dry to the touch and smells toasty, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.
Step 3
Make the filling: Whisk the cream with a stand or hand mixer (or by hand, which will take quite some time and energy) until stiff peaks form. Beat the peanut butter, cream cheese, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla and salt (with an electric mixer or by hand) until well blended and smooth. Gently stir the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture until fully incorporated. It’s OK if the cream deflates.
Step 4
Spread the peanut butter filling in an even layer over the cooled pie crust. Freeze until firm, about 30 minutes.
Step 5
Make the glaze: Bring the cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over medium heat. Turn off the heat and add the chocolate. Let sit for 30 seconds, then stir slowly until the chocolate melts. Add the coffee and corn syrup, and stir until smooth.
Step 6
Take the pie out of the freezer. Slowly pour the chocolate glaze all over the top of the pie. Tilt the pie plate if needed to evenly coat the top. Scatter the peanuts on top. Let stand until the top sets, about 15 minutes. Slice and serve, or refrigerate for up to 3 days before slicing.
Be sure to use standard peanut butter that includes sweeteners, fats and salt. Natural peanut butter, with only peanuts and salt, won’t work in this recipe.

teaspoon fine sea or table salt
1
cup/228 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes
2½
cups/330 grams all-purpose flour","466 user ratings","10 minutes, plus chilling","Step 1
Stir together the water, vinegar, sugar and salt until the sugar and salt dissolve. Put in the freezer until ready to use.
Step 2
To make the dough in a stand mixer, toss the butter with the flour in the mixer bowl until evenly coated. Beat with the paddle on low speed until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. It’s OK if there are a few pea-size clumps, but there shouldn’t be many. Add the water solution all at once and beat on low speed until the mixture forms large clumps and no floury bits remain.
Step 3
To make the dough in a food processor, pulse the butter and flour until coarse crumbs form. Add the water solution all at once and pulse until the mixture forms large clumps.
Step 4
To make the dough by hand, toss the butter with the flour in a large bowl until evenly coated. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, cut or smoosh the butter and rub it into the flour until coarse crumbs form. It’s OK if there are some almond-size pieces, but there shouldn’t be many. Add the water solution all at once and stir with a fork or your hand until the dough comes together.
Step 5
Whichever method you used, gather the dough into a large mass (about 660 grams total). If making single-crust or regular double-crust pies, divide the dough in half to form 2 disks (330 grams each). For a lattice pie, form a little more than a third of the dough into a disk for the bottom (250 grams), then split the remaining in half to form 2 disks for the top (205 grams each).
Step 6
Wrap the disks tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and preferably 1 day. The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.

teaspoon pure vanilla extract
½
teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
½
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
3
large eggs, at room temperature, plus 1 egg, beaten, for the crust","240 user ratings","4 hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Pierce the sweet potatoes all over with a fork, then wrap each in foil.
Step 2
Roast on a baking sheet until very tender, 1 to 1½ hours. A fork should slide right through. Uncover and let cool for a bit. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees.
Step 3
When the sweet potatoes are almost done, roll the dough. If the dough has been refrigerated for more than an hour, let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first. Roll the disk on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 13-inch round. It will be quite thin. Roll the dough onto the pin, then unroll it over a standard (not deep-dish) 9-inch pie plate, centering it. Gently tuck and press it into the bottom and sides of the plate without stretching the dough.
Step 4
With a sharp paring knife, trim the dough flush with the edge of the rim. (Save the scraps.) Place the pie pan on a baking sheet. Use a fork to poke holes all over the bottom of the dough without piercing all the way through, if possible. Line the dough with a sheet of crumpled parchment paper. (Crumpling helps it lie flat against the dough.) Fill the lined dough to the top with pie weights, such as dried beans.
Step 5
Bake until the edges are golden and the sides look dry, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove the weights with the parchment and return the empty pie shell to the oven. Bake until the bottom is dry and pale golden, about 5 minutes. Let cool until ready to fill. Lower the oven temperature to 325 degrees.
Step 6
Meanwhile, gather the dough scraps together and roll them into ⅛-inch-thick rectangles on a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper. Sprinkle with the sparkling sugar and gently run the rolling pin over the sugar so that it sticks to the top of the dough but still sits on top of it. Slide onto a baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 15 minutes. Cut into ¾-inch squares and return to the freezer.
Step 7
As soon as the sweet potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut a slit along the length of each and scoop the flesh out into a large bowl. (You should have about 2 packed cups.) Smash and stir into a purée with a whisk. Add the cream, granulated sugar, rum, vanilla, nutmeg and salt, and whisk until smooth. Add 3 eggs and whisk just until fully incorporated. Pour into the still-warm parbaked pie shell and smooth the top. Brush the rim of the pie crust with the remaining beaten egg.
Step 8
Take the dough squares out of the freezer, and arrange them along the rim, gently pressing them down. Bake until mostly set but still a tiny bit jiggly in the center, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes. If you have leftover dough squares, bake them on a parchment-lined baking sheet until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
Step 9
Let the pie and squares cool completely on a rack. Arrange any squares on top of the pie and serve at room temperature or refrigerate for up to 3 days.

Use a fork to poke holes all over the bottom of the dough without piercing all the way through, if possible. Line the dough with a sheet of crumpled parchment paper. (Crumpling helps it lie flat against the dough.) Fill the lined dough to the top with pie weights, such as dried beans.
Step 4
Bake on the bottom rack until the edges are light golden brown and the sides look dry, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the pie weights with the parchment and return the empty shell to the bottom rack. Bake until the bottom is golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a rack.
Step 5
Bring the maple syrup to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Boil (without stirring) until reduced to ¾ cup, about 7 minutes. Pour the syrup into a liquid measuring cup.
Step 6
Spread the brown sugar in the same saucepan off the heat (no need to wash it). Sprinkle the cornstarch and salt over it and whisk well, then whisk in the half-and-half until blended. Whisk in the egg yolks until evenly incorporated. Continue whisking and add the reduced syrup in a slow, steady stream.
Step 7
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, whisking continuously, then continue at a full boil with big bubbles, whisking often, until very thick, 7 to 10 minutes. (When you run the whisk across the bottom of the saucepan it should leave a clear trail.) Scrape into the cooled pie crust and spread in an even layer. Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate, uncovered, until cold and firm, at least 3 hours. The pie can be refrigerated for up to 3 days (and should be covered after 3 hours).
Step 8
Make the topping: Mix the cornstarch with 1 tablespoon cold water and set next to the stove. Combine the blueberries, sugar and 2 tablespoons water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Simmer just until the liquid is tinted by the berries, about 1 minute, then stir in the cornstarch mixture. Simmer, stirring continuously, until the liquid has thickened slightly, about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl. Refrigerate uncovered until cool, stirring occasionally.
Step 9
Whisk the cream with an electric mixer or by hand (which will take a while and be a workout, but it works) until medium-firm peaks form. (The peaks should stand up and curl down at the tip.)
Step 10
Dollop the cream over the chilled maple pie and swirl to create peaks and valleys. Spoon some of the berry mixture into the valleys and swirl, if you’d like. Serve immediately with the remaining berry mixture on the side.

"Pecan Sandie Pie","Pies And Tarts,Corn Syrup,Dark Brown Sugar,Dark Chocolate,Food Processor,Make Ahead,Milk Chocolate,Pecan,Pecan Pie,White Chocolate,Dessert,Thanksgiving","Yield: One 9-inch pie","For the Crust
¾
cup/80 grams pecans, lightly toasted if you’d like
1⅔
cups/209 grams all-purpose flour
¼
cup/34 grams confectioners’ sugar, plus more for dusting
¼
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
½
cup/114 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes, plus more for the pan
1
large egg, beaten
1½
teaspoons pure vanilla extract
2
ounces/56 grams dark, milk or white chocolate
For the Filling
1
cup/350 grams dark corn syrup
¾
cup/165 grams packed dark brown sugar
3
tablespoons/42 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled
3
large eggs, at room temperature
1
tablespoon rye or other whiskey (optional)
1
teaspoon pure vanilla extract
½
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
1½
cups/160 grams finely chopped pecans, lightly toasted if you’d like","976 user ratings","2 hours, plus chilling","Step 1
Make the crust: Pulse the pecans in a food processor until coarsely ground. Add the flour, confectioners’ sugar and salt, and pulse until the nuts are very finely ground. Add the butter and pulse until fully incorporated, then add the egg and vanilla, and pulse just until the dough comes together in large clumps.
Step 2
Butter the bottom and sides of a standard (not deep-dish) 9-inch pie plate. Take about two-thirds of the dough (300 grams) and press into an even layer against the bottom of the plate and up the sides to form a ⅓-inch-thick crust along the sides. The top of the dough should extend just over the inside edge of the rim. Refrigerate until firm. Meanwhile, position 1 rack on the lowest level of the oven and 1 near the top. Heat the oven to 325 degrees.
Step 3
While the oven heats, prepare the remaining one-third of the dough (about 165 grams). Pinch off a 1-inch ball of dough and refrigerate it in case you need to patch any cracks in the crust. Press the rest of the dough into a round disk on a sheet of parchment paper. If it is very sticky, refrigerate it until it’s easy to roll. If it isn’t too sticky, place a piece of plastic wrap over it and roll it into a 7-inch round. You also can pat it into a 7-inch round if you don’t have a rolling pin. Freeze on the parchment on a baking sheet until firm but not extremely hard.
Step 4
Cut the dough into 4 even strips, then cut 4 even strips at an angle, starting the cuts from the end points of the first set of strips. You want to create 2 diamonds in the middle and 8 triangles with curved edges surrounding them. (Or get creative and cut whatever shapes you’d like.) Refrigerate until firm.
Step 5
Line the dough with a sheet of crumpled parchment paper. (Crumpling helps it lie flat against the dough.) Fill the lined dough to the top with pie weights, such as dried beans. Bake on the lowest rack until golden at the edges and dry, about 25 minutes. Remove the parchment with the pie weights and return the empty shell to the oven. Bake until golden brown at the edges and set on the bottom, 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool while you prepare the filling. If there are any cracks in the dough, gently press pieces of the reserved dough into them. Be sure to patch everything, but you don’t need to bake the shell by itself again.
Step 6
Make the filling: In a large bowl, whisk the corn syrup, brown sugar, butter, eggs, rye (if using), vanilla and salt until smooth. Stir in the pecans. Pour the filling into the crust and bake on the lowest rack until set, 40 to 45 minutes, tenting with foil if the top or crust get too dark. It may still wobble a bit but shouldn’t jiggle.
Step 7
Meanwhile, lift the refrigerated dough shapes off the parchment and place them back down, spacing them 1½ inches apart. Bake on the upper rack while the pie bakes until golden brown at the edges, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool completely. (The pecan sandies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.)
Step 8
Cool the pie completely. (The whole pie can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days before topping.)
Step 9
Melt the chocolate (in a microwave-safe bowl stirring every 20 seconds or in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water). If you’d like, dust the tops of some or all of the cooled pecan sandies with confectioners’ sugar. Generously spread melted chocolate on the bottoms and arrange the shapes on top of the cooled pie. Let the chocolate set. Serve immediately or let stand at room temperature for up to 8 hours.

large eggs, at room temperature
1½

½
cup/130 grams heavy cream

cup/133 grams granulated sugar
¼
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
2
teaspoons pure vanilla extract (see Tip)
½
cup/10 grams freeze-dried strawberries or raspberries (optional)","146 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
If the dough has been refrigerated for more than an hour, let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12½-inch round. Roll the dough up onto the pin, then unroll it over a standard (not deep-dish) 9-inch pie plate, centering it. Gently tuck and press it into the bottom and sides of the plate without stretching the dough. Fold the overhang of dough under itself along the rim so that the dough extends a little over the edge of the plate. If you’d like, crimp the edges of the dough.
Step 2
If the dough has softened, refrigerate or freeze the dough until firm, about 30 minutes in the refrigerator or 10 minutes in the freezer. While the dough chills, position a rack in the lowest position in the oven and heat to 375 degrees.
Step 3
Use a fork to poke holes all over the bottom of the dough without piercing all the way through, if possible. Line the dough with a sheet of crumpled parchment paper. (Crumpling helps it lie flat against the dough.) Fill the lined dough to the top with pie weights, such as dried beans.
Step 4
Bake on the bottom rack until the edges are light golden brown and the sides look dry, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the pie weights with the parchment and return the empty shell to the bottom rack. Bake until the bottom is golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees.
Step 5
While the crust bakes, prepare the filling: Whisk the eggs in a large bowl until the whites and yolks are blended. Heat the milk, cream, sugar and salt in a medium saucepan over medium, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. When the liquid steams — don’t let it bubble — turn off the heat. Pour ¼ cup of the milk mixture into the eggs while whisking them a thin, steady stream. (This tempers the eggs, preventing them from cooking or scrambling with the addition of the hot liquid.) Repeat twice, then pour the rest of the hot milk in, whisking all the while. Whisk in the vanilla. Let sit at room temperature while the crust finishes baking.
Step 6
When the crust is out of the oven, give the filling another stir in case anything has settled on the bottom. If you want a very smooth custard or see eggy bits floating in your mixture, pour the blend through a fine-mesh sieve into the crust. (Otherwise, skip the strainer.)
Step 7
Bake until the edges are set and the center jiggles slightly, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool to room temperature on a rack. You can serve the pie as is or you can grind the dehydrated berries in a spice grinder, then sift them over the surface of the custard. The whole pie also can be refrigerated for up to 2 days before serving. It’s nice cold, but even nicer at room temperature. (Just don’t reheat it.)
You can play around with the flavors here, substituting ½ teaspoon of the vanilla for almond extract, coconut extract, rum extract or lemon extract. You want 2 teaspoons extract total and should be mindful of the potency of what you’re using when experimenting with combinations.

Using a sharp knife, make a slit cutting through the skin lengthwise on each piece, then carefully and thoroughly peel off the outer bark and the white, waxy layer underneath using your fingers. Cut out any black spots, green veins or discoloration, all of which can be poisonous. Quarter the yuca lengthwise and cut out and discard the woody cores; rinse the yuca well.
Step 3
Add the frozen or fresh yuca pieces and 1 bouillon cube to the boiling water. Boil for about 20 minutes, or until the yuca is fork-tender.

Drain the water and mash the yuca in the pot while it's still hot. Make sure to pick out any remaining pieces of the starchy core. Add the milk, butter and the remaining ½ bouillon cube. Stir over medium heat until the mixture is creamy like mashed potatoes, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately, with optional garnishes, if desired.
Yuca can be found in many Latin American grocery stores. Fresh yuca is typically located near other fresh starches, like potatoes, and frozen yuca can be found grouped with other frozen Latin American products.

2
bay leaves
¼
cup all-purpose flour
4
tablespoons unsalted butter
1
tablespoon soy sauce","1949 user ratings","About 2 hours, plus overnight dry-brining","Step 1
Dry-brine the turkey: Pat the turkey dry with paper towels. Carefully loosen the skin from the breast of the turkey — going in through the neck may be easier here — until you can slide your hand between the skin and the meat. Season each turkey breast with 1 teaspoon salt, spreading it as evenly as possible with your hands. Sprinkle the remaining salt evenly over every surface of the turkey. Place the turkey skin-side up on a rimmed sheet pan, and refrigerate, uncovered, for 12 to 24 hours.
Step 2
While the turkey dry-brines, make the herb mayo: In a tall container just wide enough to fit the head of a hand blender (or using a regular blender or food processor), combine the mayonnaise with the parsley, sage, thyme or oregano, scallions, lemon zest and 1 tablespoon water. Season generously with salt and pepper. Use the hand blender to blend until it all forms a relatively smooth, pale-green sauce. Transfer to a sealed container until ready to use. You should have about 1¾ cups of herb mayo. (You can make the mayo in advance up to a week and keep it in the fridge.)
Step 3
Roast the turkey: Take the turkey out of the refrigerator to let it rest as the oven heats. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat the oven to 425 degrees for a 10- to 12-pound bird or 400 degrees for a 12- to 14-pound bird. Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil. Scatter the diced celery, onion and carrot over it. Place a cooling rack directly on top of the vegetables, then place the turkey on top, skin-side down.
Step 4
With your hands, slather ½ cup of the herb-mayo mixture over the exposed side of the turkey, making sure to lightly coat every surface. Flip the turkey skin-side up. Spread the legs out to the sides (they should remain skin-side up) and tuck the wing tips behind the breast. With your hands, spread a couple of tablespoons of the herb mayo between the skin and meat of the breast. Generously slather the rest of the turkey with the herb mayo, getting it into every crack and crevice. (Reserve any remaining herb mayo for your day-after-Thanksgiving sandwiches.)
Step 5
Transfer the turkey to the oven and roast until the breast meat registers 150 degrees at its coolest point (typically the deepest point of the breast next to the breastbone) and the thigh and leg meat register at least 165 degrees at their coolest point (typically the center of the joint between the drumstick and thigh or thigh and hip), 80 to 90 minutes, rotating halfway through. (You may want to start checking the turkey’s internal temperature after about 1 hour.) If any of the skin starts to darken too much during roasting, tent darker areas loosely with aluminum foil. Remove from oven, transfer to a cutting board, and let it rest.
Step 6
While the turkey cooks, make the gravy: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over high until lightly smoking. Add the celery, onion, carrot and turkey parts, and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 15 minutes. Add the stock, herb stems and bay leaves. Bring to a simmer and cook gently until reduced by about half, or until the turkey is done.
Step 7
After removing the turkey from the oven, strain the stock mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a large bowl. Tilt and strain any collected liquids from the turkey-roasting tray into the same bowl. Discard the vegetables at the bottom of the tray. Skim off and discard most of the excess fat from the liquid.
Step 8
Heat the flour and butter in a medium saucepan over medium, stirring constantly with a whisk until the mixture is golden brown. Ladle the stock mixture into the saucepan, about a ½ cup at a time, whisking until smooth after each addition. Once all the stock is added, bring the gravy to a simmer until your desired consistency, stir in the soy sauce and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 9
Carve and serve the turkey with the gravy.
If spatchcocking intimidates, you can cook the turkey whole. Place a baking stone or steel directly on an oven rack set in the lowest position when heating your oven in Step 4. (Let it preheat for at least 45 minutes.) Place the whole turkey, breast-side up on the rimmed baking sheet. Roast as directed in Step 6 for 30 minutes, then reduce heat to 350 degrees, and continue roasting, tenting with aluminum foil if the skin starts brown too quickly, until the breast meat registers 150 degrees at its coolest point and the thigh and leg meat register at least 165 degrees at their coolest point, another 80 to 100 minutes. Remove from oven, transfer turkey to a cutting board as soon as you can handle it, then continue recipe as directed from Step 7.
You can make the herb mayo from scratch, if you like. In a tall container just wide enough to fit the head of a hand blender, combine 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard, 3 medium garlic cloves, 1 whole egg, and the zest and juice of 1 lemon. Top with 1 cup neutral oil, such as vegetable, light olive oil or canola, so that the oil forms a distinct layer. Place the head of a hand blender firmly at the bottom of the container. (The garlic cloves should be entirely within the business-end of the blender.) Turn on the blender and, over the course of 15 seconds, slowly pull it up through the oil. A thick, stable mayonnaise should form. Remove the blender, shaking off most of the excess mayonnaise back into the jar. Proceed with the recipe.

In a cocktail shaker, muddle the 3 half-wheels of orange (reserve the remaining half-wheel for garnish) and the simple syrup. Add the sherry and ice cubes. Cover and shake vigorously.
Step 2
Strain into chilled highball or Collins glass and top with enough crushed ice to mound above the rim. (You can also strain the cocktail a second time, if you like, to make sure there’s no pulp.) Garnish with the mint and the remaining orange half. Serve with a straw.
To crush ice without a blender: Put cubed ice in a clean canvas or plastic bag. Close tightly then, if using a plastic bag, wrap gently in a cloth napkin or tea towel. Place on a stable surface and use a rolling pin to crust the ice into small pieces. Use immediately.

Set a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper. In the warming oven or a microwave, soften the butter. Spread butter edge to edge on 4 slices of the bread. (You may not need all the butter, depending on the size of your bread.) Place the 4 slices butter-side down on half the prepared sheet pan. Top with the melting cheese, then top with the remaining 4 slices of bread.

Place on the bottom rack and cook until the bottoms are light golden and the cheese is melted, 7 to 9 minutes.
Step 3
Remove pan from the oven and sprinkle a thin layer of the hard cheese on the empty side of the pan. Spread out the cheese to create holes and lacy edges, like snowflakes, for more crisping. Use a spatula to flip the sandwiches onto the cheese so the tops of the sandwiches adhere to it. Return to the bottom rack and cook until the exterior cheese is light golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating.

Ground nutmeg, to taste

Ground cayenne, to taste

About 1 pound fresh ricotta
¾
cup grated Parmesan
¾
cup dry bread crumbs, preferably homemade","236 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Wash chard in a deep basin of cold tap water. Remove stems and reserve for another purpose (chopped and added to vegetable soup, for instance). Chop or tear chard leaves into rough 2-inch pieces.
Step 2
Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Submerge chard, turning it so it cooks evenly, and simmer over medium heat, 1 minute or so. Drain and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.
Step 3
Oil a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Heat oven to 375 degrees.
Step 4
Make a béchamel: Melt butter in a heavy 2-quart saucepan over medium heat. Add flour, stir well and let mixture cook for a minute or so, without browning. Slowly add 2 cups half-and-half, ¼ cup at a time, whisking well as mixture thickens. Turn heat to low.
Step 5
Season sauce with a good pinch of salt, a little bit of nutmeg and a speck of cayenne. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Taste and correct seasoning. Consistency should be gravylike and not too thick — thin with more half-and-half as necessary.
Step 6
While the sauce cooks, squeeze the cooled chard dry, and, using a large knife, cut it into ½-inch slices. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Top with blobs of ricotta, evenly spaced.
Step 7
Pour or spoon warm béchamel over dish, covering everything evenly to the edges. Sprinkle with Parmesan and bread crumbs. Drizzle with a little olive oil in a fine stream. Bake until bubbling and nicely browned, 40 minutes. Let cool slightly, then serve hot or warm.
This can be made up to 24 hours in advance, refrigerated, and reheated for 15 to 20 minutes in a 350-degree oven, until the casserole bubbles at the edges.

Salt and pepper
5
pounds russet potatoes
10
tablespoons butter, sliced and at room temperature, plus more for reheating
1
cup whole milk, warmed, plus more for reheating","868 user ratings","40 minutes, plus 30 minutes’ reheating, if desired","Step 1
Fill a large pot with 8 cups cold water and 1 tablespoon salt. Peel and quarter the potatoes, adding each to the cold water as you cut to prevent them from discoloring. The potatoes should be immersed. If they’re not, add enough water to cover them, along with a pinch of salt.
Step 2
Bring to a boil over high heat and continue boiling until a knife slides through the potatoes very easily, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 3
Drain well, then return the potatoes to the pot. Some should be falling apart. Heat over low, shaking the pot occasionally, until the potatoes are mottled and very dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.
Step 4
Mash in the pot, adding the butter a few pieces at a time, until smooth, then stir in the milk and season to taste with salt and pepper. Or transfer to a stand mixer and beat with the paddle on low, adding a few pieces of butter at a time, until smooth, then add the milk with the machine running. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 5
You can serve the potatoes right away or hold them for up to 3 hours: Transfer the hot potatoes to a large, wide metal bowl and evenly smooth the top. Set the bowl over a large saucepan of steaming water (or in a skillet of steaming water) over low heat. Add just enough milk to barely cover the potatoes and partly cover the bowl. Stir gently but well before serving so they’re evenly hot and creamy.
Step 6
You also can transfer the potatoes to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days. To reheat, use the setup in Step 5, but add an ⅛-inch layer of milk over the cold, flat top of the potatoes and stir the potatoes every 10 minutes to help them reheat evenly. The whole batch should be steaming hot within 30 minutes. If the mash is still stiff when hot, stir in more milk (or butter, if you’d prefer). Season to taste with salt and pepper again before serving.

(1-inch) piece fresh ginger, finely grated (about 1 tablespoon)
1
tablespoon apple cider vinegar

½ cup cilantro, roughly chopped

Steamed rice or roti and salted plain yogurt, for serving","316 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Roast the squash: Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 450 degrees. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
Scrub the squash, then remove the stem and cut in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds and discard. Cut the squash crosswise into ½-inch thick slices and transfer to the prepared baking sheet.
Step 3
Drizzle over the 3 tablespoons of melted ghee, then sprinkle over 1 ½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon turmeric. Use your hands to evenly coat the squash with the seasonings, and arrange in roughly a single layer. Roast until browned and tender, rotating the pan once during cooking, 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 4
In the meantime, prepare the gravy: In a small bowl combine the cumin, coriander, chile and remaining ½ teaspoon turmeric and have it handy.
Step 5
In a large skillet, heat the remaining 3 tablespoons ghee over medium-high for 1 minute. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until frizzled and browned, with some blackened bits, about 15 minutes. (You will develop lots of dark brown bits on the bottom of the skillet, this is just what you want.)
Step 6
Add the spices in the bowl and the ginger, and cook until fragrant and sticking to the bottom of the skillet, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Add vinegar and 1 cup water. Scrape up all browned bits with a stiff wooden spoon and bring the mixture to a simmer. Season generously with salt, to taste. (If the mixture tastes too acidic or spicy, you likely need more salt.)

Arrange the squash on a platter, top with gravy, garnish with cilantro, and serve right away with steamed rice (or roti) and salted yogurt.

Prepare the tonkatsu sauce: In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients and mix well. (Makes ⅔ cup.)

Make the hot butter: In a small bowl, combine all ingredients and whisk until well blended. Set aside.
Step 2
Make the tofu: With a hand on top of the tofu, cut parallel to the cutting board so that you have two equal rectangles. Quarter each of those rectangles, so you have eight pieces. Arrange sliced tofu on a paper towel-lined plate and top with another layer of paper towels; press to remove excess water.
Step 3
Place milk and rice flour in 2 separate shallow bowls. In a medium bowl whisk all-purpose flour, cornstarch and baking powder, and season with salt; add seltzer and gently whisk just to combine. Do not overmix; a few lumps in the batter are OK.
Step 4
Heat ½ inch of oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium to 375 degrees. Working with 4 pieces of tofu at a time, dredge in milk, then in the rice flour, pressing all sides of tofu into the rice flour. (The tofu should be completely coated with flour.) Dip in the batter, allowing excess to drip off, and add to oil. Fry undisturbed until batter sets, about 2 minutes. Continue to fry, turning gently, until golden and crisp, about 3 minutes longer, adjusting heat as necessary to stay close to 375 degrees. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, and season with salt. Repeat dredging and frying with the remaining tofu.
Step 5
Spread mayonnaise on the insides of buns. (If using sliced bread, cut into quarters for slider-size portions.) Arrange lettuce on bottom buns. Gently turn each piece of tofu in the hot butter to evenly coat, then place on top of lettuce. Drizzle with more hot butter, top with pickles and finish with bun tops. Serve warm.

Add the Parmesan and toss, still over low heat, until the noodles are slicked with a creamy sauce, adding a spoonful or two of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce. Divide among serving dishes and top with Parmesan and more chile crisp, if you’d like. Serve immediately.
You can make chile crisp easily at home or buy it in supermarkets or online. It varies in spiciness, so adjust the amount to your taste. For this dish, try to add more of the solids than the oil to the sauce for the most flavorful dish.

½ pound green beans, trimmed
1½
tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1
tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
¼
teaspoon red-pepper flakes
2
garlic cloves, finely grated

Salt","343 user ratings","10 minutes","Step 1
Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, combine the green beans, vinegar, olive oil, red-pepper flakes and garlic. (If there are any nubbins of garlic left after grating, throw those pieces into the air fryer as well; those bits transform into tasty crisps, golden on the outside but still tender and soft inside.) Season the green beans with salt and toss to coat, massaging the garlic onto the green beans.
Step 3
Transfer green beans to the air fryer basket and scrape any remaining dressing on top. Fry at 375 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, tossing with tongs or shaking the basket halfway through, until the green beans are charred in spots and fork-tender. (If you like your green beans with more bite, fry them on the lower end of this time range.)
Step 4
Transfer green beans and any crisped garlic pieces back to the mixing bowl or to a new serving bowl and top with any remaining sauce from the air fryer. Season to taste with salt and serve hot or at room temperature.

cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish","623 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
In a mixing bowl, combine paneer, 3 tablespoons yogurt and ghee. Toss until paneer is well coated, then spread it in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle lightly with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Roast until the edges are golden, about 13 to 18 minutes.
Step 3
While the paneer is in the oven, make the tomato curry: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high. Add cumin, fenugreek (if using), cardamom and cinnamon, and let cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add onions and sauté until tender and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, ginger, 1 teaspoon garam masala, turmeric, cayenne and ½ teaspoon salt, and cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.

"Pecan Tarts","American,Southern,Cream Cheese,Make Ahead,Pastry Flour,Pecan,Tart,Dessert,Thanksgiving","Yield: 9 tarts","For the Pastry Shells
⅔
cup/151 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for the pan
4
ounces/114 grams cream cheese, softened
1⅓
cups/160 grams pastry flour (or 1⅓ cups/171 grams all-purpose flour)
½
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
For the Filling
1
large egg

cup/165 grams packed brown sugar
1
tablespoon melted unsalted butter
1
teaspoon vanilla extract
½
teaspoon honey
¼
teaspoon ground nutmeg
⅔
cup/79 grams very finely chopped pecans","260 user ratings","2½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Prepare the pastry: Beat softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer or by hand until thoroughly combined. If flour is clumpy, sift it into the bowl, then add salt. (Otherwise, simply add flour and salt.) Mix on low speed to combine into a pliant pastry dough (it will be somewhat sticky), then turn out onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Use the wrap to press the dough into a square, then wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1½ hours.
Step 2
Prepare the filling: In a medium bowl, beat egg with an electric mixer or by hand. Add the brown sugar, melted butter, vanilla, honey and nutmeg and mix until well combined, then stir in the pecans.
Step 3
Make the tarts: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Grease 9 cavities of a mini tart pan or standard muffin tin with butter. Divide chilled dough into 9 even pieces and place 1 in a buttered cup. Press the dough against the bottom and side to form a shell. This may take a moment. Repeat with the remaining 8 pieces of dough. Be careful to smooth out any cracks, tears or holes in your pastry as you fill the pan.
Step 4
Divide pecan filling among pastry shells, filling each no more than three-quarters of the way. Be careful not to overfill.
Step 5
Bake tarts until browned and set, 27 to 32 minutes. Cool in the pan for 20 minutes, then carefully remove tarts from the pan, using a knife to ease them out. Serve at your leisure.

1
cup heavy cream, plus more as needed

ounces low-moisture, whole-milk mozzarella, grated","393 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Cut the thick stems off the broccoli and reserve for another use. Place the broccoli crown cut-side down. Using a sharp knife and following the shape of the crown, shave off only the dark green tops of the florets, avoiding any stems which can affect the creaminess of the purée. (You’ll need 5 to 6 cups shaved broccoli.) Reserve the naked florets for another use.
Step 2
Melt the butter in a medium, heavy pot over medium heat. Add the shaved broccoli and 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until bright green and softened, 6 to 8 minutes.
Step 3
Add the cream and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring frequently, until most of the cream is absorbed by the broccoli, 3 to 5 minutes.
Step 4
Transfer broccoli mixture to a blender and purée on high until completely smooth, adding a tablespoon or two of cream to get it moving if necessary, and periodically stopping to stir the mixture with a spatula.
Step 5
Transfer the broccoli purée back to the same pot and place over medium heat. Add a handful of cheese and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon or stiff silicone spatula until thoroughly melted. Repeat with the remaining cheese, waiting until the first addition has integrated before adding the next handful. Keep stirring vigorously until the mixture is stretchy. (Do not let the mixture come to a simmer, but be sure it’s hot enough for the cheese to melt or it won’t stretch.)
Step 6
Remove from heat. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.

1
(13-ounce/370-gram) jar raspberry jam or red currant jelly (about 1 heaped cup)

Flaky salt

Confectioners’ sugar","435 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 350 degrees. Grease a metal 9-inch square baking pan and line the bottom and two sides with one long piece of parchment, leaving a 1-inch of overhang and creasing the parchment to fit snugly into the pan.
Step 2
In a food processor, pulse together ½ cup (60 grams) pecans, the sugar, salt, zest, cinnamon and baking powder until very finely ground. Add butter and pulse until creamy and combined; stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor. Add egg and pulse to evenly combine; stop to scrape down the sides of the food processor. Add the flour and pulse until just combined (do not overmix).
Step 3
Put two-thirds (about 360 grams) of the dough into the prepared pan and use an offset spatula to spread the dough into an even layer. Bake until dry and lightly golden, rotating the pan once during baking, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly, about 15 minutes.
Step 4
In the meantime, finely chop the remaining ½ cup (60 grams) pecans and mix into the remaining cookie dough.
Step 5
Use an offset spatula to evenly spread the jam onto the crust. Evenly crumble over the remaining cookie dough, lightly sprinkle with flaky salt and bake until the topping is browned and the jam is bubbling, rotating the pan once during baking, about 30 minutes.
Step 6
Cool completely, at least 1½ hours, then run an offset spatula along the edges to loosen and use the parchment to lift the bars out of the pan. Using a fine mesh strainer, dust with confectioners’ sugar. Use a sharp knife to cut crosswise into three 3-inch wide strips. Divide each strip into six 1½-inch wide bars. (In an airtight container, the bars will keep at room temperature for up to 1 week.)

(¼-ounce) packets unflavored powdered gelatin
3
cups/12 ounces fresh or frozen thawed cranberries
1
medium green apple, unpeeled, cored and coarsely chopped (2 cups)","208 user ratings","40 minutes, plus 4 hours’ chilling","Step 1
Heat a small skillet over medium-high, then add the nuts and toast, shaking the pan occasionally, until fragrant and slightly darker in color, about 30 seconds. Set aside to cool slightly. Zest the limes into a small bowl and, using your fingers, rub 3 tablespoons sugar into the zest until fragrant and well combined. To this lime sugar, add ½ cup cooled nuts and, if using, citric acid and toss to combine. Set aside for later.
Step 2
Lightly grease a 3-cup jelly mold, Bundt pan or wide shallow bowl with nonstick spray or a paper towel dipped in oil.
Step 3
Pour ½ cup juice into a 4-cup liquid measuring cup or large bowl and stir in the gelatin; set aside to soak (the gelatin will hydrate and thicken the juice).
Step 4
To a medium pot, add 2½ cups cranberries, 1½ cups chopped apple and the remaining 1½ cups of juice and ¼ cup sugar and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer, swirling the pan occasionally, until the cranberries burst and the apple softens slightly, about 5 minutes. Squeeze ¼ cup juice from the zested limes and add to the pot. Strain this hot cranberry-apple juice mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into the gelatin without pressing down on the solids. Stir to combine. Set aside to cool to lukewarm, about 10 minutes.
Step 5
Stir the remaining ¼ cup toasted nuts, ½ cup cranberries and ½ cup chopped apple into the cooled juice mixture and pour into the jelly mold. Transfer to the refrigerator to set until solid but jiggly, at least 4 hours or up to overnight. To unmold the jelly, fill a pan larger than the mold with hot water from the tap. Dip the mold into the hot water (don’t let hot water get inside the mold) until the edges of the gelatin look wet, a few seconds to 3 minutes depending on the thickness of your mold. Cover the mold with a large plate and quickly (and confidently) flip it. You can make this jelly up to 3 days in advance; keep the unmolded gelatin covered and refrigerated until ready to unmold, and be sure to unmold a few minutes before serving for a softer texture. Unmold the jelly and sprinkle with the lime-sugared nuts.

teaspoon ground clove
2
cups/242 grams confectioners’ sugar","325 user ratings","4 hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Generously butter a 10-inch bundt pan. Reserve 1 tablespoon flour and 2 tablespoons brown sugar.
Step 2
In a small pot, warm the milk over medium heat until just warm to the touch (110 degrees). (Or, microwave the milk for 30 to 45 seconds.) Transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer. Sprinkle in the yeast and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Zest the lemon over the mixture and add the eggs, nutmeg, salt and the remaining flour and brown sugar. Using a spatula, stir to form a shaggy dough.
Step 3
Fit the mixer with a dough hook and knead on low until a smooth dough forms, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and add the butter all at once. Knead on low until the butter is incorporated and the dough is smooth, sticky and elastic, about 6 minutes. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let rise for 1 hour.
Step 4
While the dough is rising, toss together 2 tablespoons brandy with the raisins and cranberries in a small bowl. Cover and let sit until the raisins and cranberries are plump and rehydrated. Add the reserved flour and brown sugar, and the vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and clove. Stir to combine.
Step 5
Add the spiced fruit mixture to the dough. Using a spatula, fold the dough over the fruit repeatedly to incorporate it. Scrape the dough into the prepared bundt pan and even out the surface. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise until the dough springs back when you make a depression in it, about 1 ½ hours. Heat the oven to 350 degrees.
Step 6
Bake on a sheet pan until golden brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or you get a hollow sound when the surface is tapped, about 40 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan for 5 minutes.
Step 7
While the cake cools, juice the zested lemon. In a small bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar, a pinch of salt, the remaining ½ tablespoon of brandy and 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Whisk together to make a smooth glaze, adding more lemon juice if necessary to make a runny but opaque glaze.
Step 8
Carefully invert the cake onto a rack or large plate. Immediately brush a thin layer of glaze over the warm cake, and let the glaze set until the cake has cooled to almost room temperature. Pour the remaining glaze over the top. Cool completely, then slice and serve. Store any leftovers covered at room temperature for up to 3 days.

garlic cloves, minced
2
cups chicken stock or vegetable stock

Salt and black pepper
1
tablespoon hot sauce (such as Tabasco) or apple cider vinegar
½
teaspoon liquid smoke (optional)","36 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Thoroughly wash the mustard greens: Rinse each leaf well, and then submerge under water in a large bowl or clean sink. Remove the leaves from the water and place in a colander. The grainy dirt that’s removed from the greens will accumulate at the bottom of the bowl. Rinse and refill the bowl, then repeat the process with the greens until there’s no remaining dirt. This normally takes 3 cycles.
Step 2
Tear the mustard green leaves from the stems. Discard the stems, then roughly chop the leaves and place them in a large bowl.
Step 3
Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven or large, heavy skillet over medium-high. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute.
Step 4
Add the stock, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper and the chopped mustard greens to the pot. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to a hearty simmer. Cook, uncovered, until the greens are very tender and no longer bitter, 35 to 45 minutes.
Step 5
Remove from the heat and stir in the hot sauce. Add the liquid smoke (if using): As the intensity of liquid smoke varies by brand, it’s best to add it gradually, tasting as you go, until it’s deliciously smoky but not overpowering. Season the mustard greens with more salt, if you like. Allow to cool slightly before serving. The greens are best the day they’re made.

3
tablespoons mirin, plus more as needed
1
pound fresh or frozen udon noodles

Shichimi or nanami togarashi, or use your favorite chile powder (optional)","511 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Make the dashi: Combine 2 quarts cold water and the kombu in a medium saucepan, and place over medium heat. As soon as the water boils, remove from heat and add the katsuobushi, pushing it gently into the water to submerge (don’t stir vigorously). Steep for 5 to 10 minutes. Strain and discard the kombu and katsuobushi (or reserve to make another batch of weaker dashi) and return the dashi to the saucepan. Keep warm, but don’t let it boil.
Step 2
Cook the beef: Combine the shaved beef, onion, scallion whites, sugar, sake, soy sauce, mirin and 1 cup of the finished dashi in a large skillet or sauté pan. Bring to a simmer over high heat, stirring. Continue cooking over high heat, stirring frequently, until the beef and onions are tender and the mixture is still moist but not soupy, 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 3
As beef cooks, bring a pot of unsalted water to a boil — udon noodles are typically made with plenty of salt in the dough — and cook the udon noodles according to package directions.
Step 4
To serve, add the soy sauce and mirin to the reserved dashi and stir. Taste and adjust seasoning to taste with more soy sauce or mirin. (The broth should have a balanced savory-sweet flavor.)
Step 5
Divide the cooked noodles across 4 large serving bowls. Ladle the broth on top of the noodles. Divide the beef and onion mixture evenly across the noodles, including any liquid in the pan. Top each bowl with sliced scallion greens. (You may have extra.) Serve immediately with shichimi togarashi to taste.
You can use instant dashi powder, such as Hondashi, in place of homemade dashi. Katsuobushi, kombu and shichimi togarashi can be found at any Japanese supermarket or many well-stocked Western supermarkets, or ordered online. You can find thinly shaved beef intended for shabu-shabu, sukiyaki or other hot pots at most Asian supermarkets. Alternatively, if you have a source for high-quality shaved beef for cheesesteaks, you can use that. If you can’t find shaved beef, you can use regular ground beef (any fat percentage will do) to achieve different but delicious results.
If you prefer, you can turn this recipe into gyudon (Japanese beef and rice bowls): Omit the noodles and broth (making only enough dashi to cook the beef) and serve the cooked beef mixture on top of bowls of steamed white rice. Garnish with beni shoga (pickled red ginger) and a poached or fried egg.

Bring the sweet potatoes to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the sweet potatoes are al dente and you can pierce their flesh with a fork with pressure, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sweet potatoes to a large, oven-proof cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven.
Step 2
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Add the pineapple juice, brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon to the skillet. Cook over medium until the sugar has dissolved; stir to combine. Arrange the sweet potatoes evenly in the skillet, then add the butter pieces on top.
Step 3
Use an oven mitt to transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the sweet potatoes, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender and their flesh easily yields to the tines of a fork, 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 4
Transfer the skillet to the stovetop and bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce to a hearty simmer. Cook, until the liquid forms a thick syrup and coats the sweet potatoes, about 3 minutes. Serve warm.

1
pound large or extra-large shrimp, shelled (deveined, if you like)
1
lemon
½
cup chopped parsley","1160 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
In a large, preferably nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add gnocchi to the pan, breaking up any that are stuck together. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes, tossing every 1 to 2 minutes, so they get golden and crispy all over. Transfer to a bowl or plate.

In the same skillet over medium-high, add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and all of the butter, letting it melt for a few seconds. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add wine, ½ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon black pepper and all of the red-pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, and let the wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes.
Step 3
Add shrimp and sauté until they just start to turn pink, 2 to 3 minutes, depending on their size.
Step 4
Return gnocchi to the pan and add another ¼ teaspoon salt. Using a Microplane or other fine grater, grate the zest from the lemon into the pan. Add parsley, tossing well. If your pan looks dry, add a splash of water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing to combine, then remove pan from the heat.

2
cups fresh or frozen shelled lima beans","1572 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Heat a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high. Add enough olive oil to generously coat the bottom of the pot. Add the onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, translucent and starting to brown at the edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Stir in the bay leaves, celery seeds and cayenne, and cook until fragrant, just a few seconds.
Step 2
Add the tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce and sugar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are softened and much of their liquid has released, 7 to 9 minutes.
Step 3
Stir in the potatoes and chicken stock, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and continue simmering, stirring occasionally, until the stew thickens slightly and the potatoes are falling apart, about 1 hour. Using the back of a spoon, gently crush most of the potatoes against the side of the pot.

Add the chicken, corn and lima beans. Continue simmering, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is soft and easily shreddable, about 1 hour.
Step 5
Remove the chicken from the pot, shred with two forks and return to the pot. (Alternatively, you can leave the chicken pieces whole; large chunks of stewed thigh meat taste delicious here.)
Step 6
Taste for seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, cayenne and sugar as desired. Serve immediately or refrigerate in airtight containers for up to 4 days. You also can freeze it for up to 4 months before thawing and reheating.

cups hearty greens, such as mature spinach, turnip greens, collards or kale, chopped with stems

Steamed rice, fonio or millet, for serving
1
lime, sliced, for squeezing","936 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium, and add the onion and garlic. Sauté until soft and just beginning to brown at the edges, about 6 minutes. Add in the grated ginger and sauté until fragrant, 1 minute.
Step 2
Add the tomato paste, stirring to evenly coat the vegetables. Cook until the paste turns brick red, 1 minute. Add the whole tomatoes and their liquid, breaking up the tomatoes in the pot. Stir and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen any bits that have stuck to the surface. Using a sharp knife, poke slits in the Scotch bonnet and drop it into the pot. Season the sauce with salt, and bring the sauce to a simmer.
Step 3
Add the plantains and cook until they just begin to soften, 10 minutes. Add the butternut squash, carrots and vegetable stock. Increase the heat to high and bring the stew up to a boil. Once the liquid is bubbling, reduce heat to medium. Cook until the vegetables are just fork tender, about 15 minutes. In a small bowl, combine the peanut butter with ¼ cup hot liquid from the pot. Stir into a loose sauce.
Step 4
Stir the peanut butter mixture into the pot. Add the tamarind purée, ground dawadawa or fish sauce, if using. Stir in the greens. Drop the heat to low and let the sauce simmer, stirring frequently, for another 10 minutes or until the sauce is thickened to a creamy but loose consistency. Remove from heat, taste and season with more salt if necessary. Remove the Scotch bonnet chile and discard. Serve maafé over steamed rice, fonio or millet, with a couple of lime slices for squeezing.
Maafé lends itself to a variety of fall vegetables: potatoes, pumpkin, kabocha or any type of squash, parsnips, turnips, sweet potatoes, or a mix of mushrooms. Substitute the amounts above with the same amounts of any mix of vegetables.
Dawadawa, also known as iru or ogiri, is a fermented locust bean product frequently used in West African cooking to add deep, robust flavor to soups and stews. It can be found as a ground powder or whole beans in the spice aisles of any African grocer. Possible alternatives are fish sauce or fermented black beans.

1
egg, beaten, for brushing
¼
teaspoon fennel seed (optional), crushed","1068 user ratings","1 ¼ hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with foil.
Step 2
Heat the olive oil in a medium (10-inch) skillet or Dutch oven (preferably oven-safe), over medium. Add the onion, carrots, celery and garlic and cook until just beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add the mushrooms, rosemary sprig and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly soft and much of the liquid has sweated out, about 10 minutes.
Step 3
Stir in the butter until melted. Add the flour and cook, stirring, to coat the vegetables and to brown slightly, about 3 minutes. Add the broth by the cupful, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and scraping up any bits from the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a simmer and stir until it thickens to make a gravy. Reduce the heat, stir in the cream and cook over low heat just until combined. Add the chicken, remaining 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper, and stir over low heat until chicken is mostly cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the peas; discard the rosemary sprig. Season the gravy to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 4
If the pan you are using is not oven-safe, transfer the mixture to a deep, 10-inch pie pan or baking pan. Transfer the pan to the prepared sheet pan to collect any drips. Unroll the puff pastry and place it over the filling, making sure there is a 1-inch overhang on all sides, stretching slightly if needed. Trim any excess pastry with a sharp knife and set aside (see Tip).
Step 5
Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg, and carefully create several small slits in any pattern of your choosing to allow steam to escape while cooking. Scatter small rosemary sprigs over the top, along with fennel seed or pepper, if desired.
Step 6
Bake until the puff pastry is puffed and golden brown, about 20 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake until the pastry is cooked through and the filling is bubbly, 15 minutes more. Remove from the heat and set aside for 10 to 15 minutes to cool slightly before serving.
While your oven is hot, cut any puff-pastry trimmings into strips, then brush with egg wash, sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar and bake until golden for an instant treat.

Place a rack in the center position of the oven and heat oven to 400 degrees.
Step 2
Peel the butternut squash. Cut the butternut squash in half across, then cut the halves in half lengthwise. Discard any seeds and slice each piece into ¼-inch-thick half moons. Place the squash on a large sheet pan, drizzle with the oil and season well with about 1 teaspoon salt; season with black pepper to taste. Toss and spread out in a single layer.
Step 3
Roast for 12 minutes, then flip the squash slices (using two forks works well) and continue to roast until cooked through (but not falling apart) and slightly golden around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes more.
Step 4
Meanwhile, add the vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, garlic slices and a pinch of salt to a small saucepan, then stir and bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Immediately reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the sugar fully dissolves and the mixture reduces to a slightly syrupy consistency, 6 to 8 minutes. Halfway through, taste the syrup and add more sugar, one tablespoon at a time, if desired. Remove from the heat. You should have about ¼ cup syrup.
Step 5
Place the butternut squash in a serving dish, tear half of the mint leaves and scatter over the squash. Drizzle the syrup over the squash. Depending on the size of your dish, you can create layers of squash, mint and syrup. Set aside at room temperature to marinate for at least 2 hours. As the squash cools, tip the dish a little to one side, spoon some syrup and drizzle it over the top of the squash. Repeat as often as you think to. Garnish with the remaining mint leaves and serve.

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Season the pork chops all over with salt and pepper. Add the oil and the pork chops to the skillet. Cook, flipping every 2 minutes, until browned on the outside and the internal temperature in the thickest part is around 130 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes depending on thickness of pork chops.

Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and brown sugar, for seasoning (optional)

Finely chopped fresh chives, for sprinkling (optional)","940 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the steaks: Grate about a quarter of the onion into a medium bowl (you should have about ¼ cup of pulp). Set aside the remaining onion for the gravy. Add the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, brown sugar and egg; season generously with salt and pepper and whisk to combine. Add the ground beef and panko, and with a spoon or fork, gently stir the mixture to combine without overmixing. Form into 8 small, oval-shaped patties about 1 inch thick, place on a plate and into the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes to firm up.
Step 2
Meanwhile, finely dice the remaining onion. Using a wet towel, wipe the mushrooms clean and thinly slice them.
Step 3
Cook the steaks: Heat a large skillet over medium and add enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom. Remove the patties from the freezer, add them to the hot oil and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
Step 4
Prepare the gravy: To the same skillet, add the onion and mushrooms, season with salt and raise the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally until deeply browned but not burned, 8 to 10 minutes. The vegetables will release their water before starting to brown, so be patient. Add more oil if the pan looks dry.
Step 5
Sprinkle over the flour and cook, stirring, until you can no longer see streaks of white and the raw flour taste cooks out, about 30 seconds.
Step 6
Stir in the beef stock and milk. Season generously with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Taste the sauce and season to taste with ½ to 1 teaspoon Worcestershire if you’d like more savoriness, 1 tablespoon ketchup for tanginess and a pinch of brown sugar for a little sweetness. Add the seared steaks to the gravy and reduce the heat to continue simmering, basting the steaks once or twice, until the gravy is thicker and reduced to your liking, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately and sprinkle with chives, if you’d like.

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bring 2 cups of water to boil in a small pot. Place the porcini mushrooms in a medium bowl and pour the boiling water on top; set aside to soak and soften.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large (12-inch) ovenproof skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Working in two batches so the mushrooms brown evenly, add half the oyster mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 3 minutes. Stir the mushrooms, then continue to cook until browned all over, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with 2 tablespoons oil and the remaining oyster mushrooms; transfer them to the medium bowl. Add another 2 tablespoons oil, then add the cremini mushrooms, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, 6 to 8 minutes, lowering the heat as needed to avoid burning. Transfer to the bowl.
Step 3
Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter to the skillet. Once the butter is melted, add the onion and cook until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add the kale, garlic, thyme and rosemary, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons oil if the pan seems dry. Sprinkle with the flour and cook, stirring, until flour is dispersed and lightly toasted, 2 minutes.
Step 4
Stirring constantly, gradually add the stock, cream and ¾ cup of the liquid from the soaking porcini mushrooms. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, then stir in the carrots, parsnips, potatoes, and the sautéed mushrooms and any accumulated juices. Strain the soaked porcini mushrooms, discarding any remaining liquid, then roughly chop the mushrooms and stir them into the filling. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (If making ahead, the filling can be refrigerated a day in advance; just warm it up slightly before assembling and baking.)
Step 5
On a lightly dusted work surface using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the puff pastry into a roughly 14-inch circle. Transfer to the top of the skillet, allowing slight overhang, folding under and pinching any overhang just below the rim of the skillet. In a small bowl, whisk the egg with 1 teaspoon water. Lightly brush the egg wash over the top of the puff pastry, then cut 5 (2-inch) slits into the puff pastry, starting near the center and radiating outward, like the rays of the sun, or create a stripe or crisscross pattern in the puff pastry by gently scoring it with a paring knife without fully cutting through. Crimp the edges using the tines of a fork, if desired.
Step 6
Set the skillet on top of an aluminum foil-lined baking sheet and transfer to the middle rack of the oven. Bake until the puff pastry is puffed and golden, about 30 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.

Prepare the caramel: Add 2 tablespoons water and the butter to a 12-inch oven-safe skillet with high sides. Sprinkle the sugar in an even layer over the bottom of the pan (try to avoid getting any sugar on the sides of the pan). Heat the skillet over medium-high heat.

In a large pot, heat the oil over medium. Add the onion, carrot, celery, garlic and pancetta; season with a good pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes.
Step 2
Add the potatoes and rosemary, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, just until the potatoes are no longer completely raw and the rosemary is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Cover with 6 cups of water, then add the Parmesan rind and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir, scraping up any bits that may have stuck to the bottom of the pot, and bring to a gentle boil. Partially cover, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until the potatoes have completely softened, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 3
With the back of a wooden spoon, smush a few of the potatoes against the side of the pot, then taste the broth and adjust seasoning. Add the pasta, raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through, about 12 minutes. Keep an eye on the liquid amount. If you prefer a thinner soup, add more water as needed. If you prefer a thicker broth, you can smoosh more potatoes for a starchier consistency, but be mindful that the soup will thicken significantly as it sits (see Tip).
Step 4
Remove the rosemary sprig and Parmesan rind, and serve the soup with grated Parmesan or pecorino, and more black pepper, if you like.
The soup will really thicken as it sits. Add more water and adjust seasoning when reheating.

Unsalted butter, at room temperature, for ramekins
7
tablespoons/87 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling and for ramekins
3
large egg yolks
⅓
cup/80 grams whole milk
2
tablespoons brewed coffee
2
tablespoons all-purpose flour
2
tablespoons Dutch-processed cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy
4
ounces/113 grams bittersweet chocolate (70 percent cacao), coarsely chopped
1
teaspoon vanilla extract
5
large egg whites, at room temperature
¾
teaspoon kosher salt","230 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Brush the bottoms and sides of 4 (6-ounce) ramekins with room-temperature butter, using straight, upward strokes along the sides and brushing all the way to the rim. Sprinkle the ramekins with sugar and shake to coat, then tap out the excess. (The upward strokes and sugar give the batter something to cling to as it rises.) Set aside ramekins.
Step 2
Fill a medium saucepan with about 1 inch of water and bring to a simmer over medium heat, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. In a medium heatproof bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons/37 grams of the sugar and 2 of the egg yolks until combined, then whisk more vigorously until the mixture is pale, light and thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stream in the milk, whisking constantly, followed by the coffee. Add the flour and cocoa powder, and whisk until the mixture is smooth and lump-free, then set the bowl over the saucepan, taking care that the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Cook the mixture over the double boiler, whisking constantly, until it’s the consistency of thin pancake batter, faintly holds the marks of the whisk and any foam has subsided, about 5 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan (careful: It’s hot).
Step 3
Add the chopped chocolate to the bowl and whisk briefly to incorporate it, then set aside the bowl for a few minutes to allow the chocolate to melt. Slowly whisk the mixture until smooth, then whisk in the remaining egg yolk and the vanilla extract. Set aside the bowl to cool slightly. (Don’t let it cool completely, or the chocolate will harden.)
Step 4
In a large metal or glass bowl — avoid plastic, as it can hold on to fat residue — combine the egg whites and salt, and use a hand mixer to beat on medium-low speed until the whites are broken up and frothy, about 20 seconds. Increase the speed to medium-high and continue to beat until the whites are foamy and opaque, about 30 seconds, then gradually add the remaining 4 tablespoons/50 grams sugar in a slow, steady stream, beating constantly. Once all the sugar is added, continue to beat just until you have dense, glossy egg whites that hold a stiff peak. Try not to overbeat, or the whites will take on a dry, grainy texture and be difficult to incorporate into the chocolate base.
Step 5
Scrape about one-third of the beaten egg whites into the bowl with the chocolate mixture, and whisk quickly and briefly to combine. Using a large flexible spatula and broad, decisive strokes, fold in the remaining beaten egg whites in 2 additions, scraping the bottom and sides of the bowl and rotating the bowl as you work, until the mixture is almost entirely streak-free.
Step 6
Gently scrape the batter into the prepared ramekins, dividing it evenly and using all of it. (The ramekins should be filled to the very top.) Tap the ramekins delicately on the work surface to help settle the batter, then, working one ramekin at a time, use a small offset spatula or a butter knife to smooth the surface and, working over the batter bowl, scrape off any excess batter so that it’s level and flush with the very top of the ramekin. If necessary, transfer any excess batter from one ramekin to another to ensure they're all filled to the very top. Repeat until all the ramekins are leveled. (At this point you could have a small amount of batter left over — if so, discard it.)
Step 7
Lightly sprinkle the surfaces of the batter with a thin, even layer of sugar, then, working with one ramekin at a time, run a clean thumb around the inside of the rims to wipe away a ring of batter and expose the inner lip of the ramekins all the way around. (Use the natural indentation inside the ramekins as a guide for how deep to make the ring.) This will ensure that your soufflés rise straight upward and maintain level tops. Wipe away any streaks of batter from the rim and outsides of the ramekins.
Step 8
Place the ramekins on a sheet pan, spacing them evenly. Transfer the sheet pan to the oven, immediately reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees and bake until the soufflés are risen, firm and springy to the touch across the surfaces, and have a slight wobble, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the soufflés from the oven and serve immediately.

disk All-Butter Pie Crust

All-purpose flour, for rolling
1
cup/211 grams granulated sugar
¼
teaspoon fine sea or table salt
2
medium lemons
3
cups/343 grams fresh or frozen cranberries
2
packed tablespoons cornstarch
4
large eggs, separated
3
tablespoons/42 grams cold unsalted butter
¼
teaspoon cream of tartar
½
cup/70 grams confectioners’ sugar","1026 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling and chilling","Step 1
If the dough has been refrigerated for more than an hour, let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12½-inch round. Roll the dough up onto the pin, then unroll it over a standard (not deep-dish) 9-inch pie plate, centering it. Gently tuck and press it into the bottom and sides of the plate without stretching the dough. Fold the overhang of the dough under itself along the rim so that the dough is flush with the edge of the plate. If you’d like, crimp the edges of the dough.
Step 2
If the dough has softened, refrigerate or freeze it until firm, about 30 minutes in the refrigerator or 10 minutes in the freezer. While the dough chills, position a rack in the lowest position in the oven and heat to 375 degrees.
Step 3
Use a fork to poke holes all over the bottom of the dough without piercing all the way through, if possible. Line the dough with a sheet of crumpled parchment paper. (Crumpling helps it lie flat against the dough.) Fill the lined dough to the top with pie weights, such as dried beans.
Step 4
Bake on the bottom rack until the edges are light golden brown, the sides look dry and the bottom looks almost dry, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the pie weights with the parchment and return the empty shell to the bottom rack. Bake until the bottom is golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Cool on a rack.
Step 5
Place the sugar and salt in a large saucepan and zest the lemons directly over it. Gently rub the zest into the sugar. Into a small bowl, squeeze a scant ½ cup juice from the lemons; set aside. Add the cranberries and 1¼ cups water to the saucepan, and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Boil until all of the cranberries have popped and collapsed and the liquid is red, syrupy and filled with cranberry seeds, 8 to 10 minutes.
Step 6
Pour the cranberry mixture through a sieve, pressing on the berries to extract all of their juice and scraping everything off the underside of the sieve. (You should have 2 cups; discard the solids inside the sieve.) Add the cornstarch to the empty saucepan (no need to wash) and whisk in 2 tablespoons cold water until smooth. Add the egg yolks and whisk until smooth, then use a spatula to stir in the strained cranberry mixture.
Step 7
Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring continuously, then continue to boil while stirring until very thick, 3 to 5 minutes. The mixture should be boiling hard with big bubbles. Turn off the heat, and stir in the cold butter and reserved lemon juice until the butter melts. Pour into the cooled pie shell and spread evenly. (At this point, the pie can be cooled completely, covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Bring back to room temperature before topping with the meringue.)
Step 8
Whisk the egg whites with an electric hand or stand mixer on medium-high speed until foamy on top. Add the cream of tartar and continue whisking until soft peaks form. When you lift the whisk from the mixture, the top will droop back down. Add the confectioners’ sugar, sifting it if it’s at all lumpy. Whisk on medium-high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form. When you lift the whisk from the mixture, the top should stand up and just the tip will have a curlicue.
Step 9
Pile the meringue in the center of the warm pie filling, leaving a 1- to 2-inch rim of filling if you’d like. (If covering the filling, spread the meringue over the crust.) Use a kitchen blowtorch to brown the meringue all over or, bake at 375 degrees until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Cool the pie at room temperature until the filling is set very firm. If the meringue weeps moisture onto the filling, dab it away with a paper towel.

All-purpose flour, for rolling
2
tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
2
tablespoons heavy cream

Sparkling or other coarse sugar, for sprinkling","338 user ratings","2½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
In a very large bowl, whisk the granulated sugar, cornstarch, spice and salt. Add the blackberries, apples and lemon juice, and stir until the fruit is evenly coated. Let stand for at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours for the fruit to get juicy, stirring now and then.
Step 2
If the dough has been refrigerated for more than an hour, let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes first. On a lightly floured surface, use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll the dough for the bottom (250 grams) into a 13½-inch round. Roll the dough up onto the pin, then unroll it over a deep-dish 9- or 9½-inch pie plate, centering it. Gently tuck and press it into the bottom and sides of the plate without stretching the dough, trimming the edges ¼ inch past the rim. Refrigerate until firm and ready to fill.
Step 3
On a lightly floured sheet of parchment paper, roll 1 of the disks for the lattice top into a 12-inch round. Cut a 3-inch-wide strip followed by a 1½-inch-wide strip. Repeat for 5 strips total, 3 thick and 2 thin. Slide the dough on the parchment onto a baking sheet and refrigerate. Repeat with the remaining dough disk, cutting in the same way, then chilling.
Step 4
Set a rack in the lowest position in the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a half-sheet pan with parchment paper.
Step 5
Take the pie plate out of the refrigerator. Stir the apple mixture well and scoop half into the raw bottom dough. Spread in an even layer and pack down as firmly as possible to eliminate gaps between the fruit. Scrape in the rest of the filling and all the juices in the bowl, and scatter the cold butter bits evenly over the fruit. Press down on the fruit, tucking in the butter bits so they’re not sitting on top. The fruit will be taller than the pie plate.
Step 6
Take the 2 rounds of dough strips out of the refrigerator. Lay the 5 strips of one round on top of the pie so the strips, alternating thick and thin, are touching but not overlapping and completely cover the filling. Lift and fold back the 3 thick strips at the midsection of the pie, and lay a thick strip from the other round down at an angle. Unfold the thick strips over the angled thick strip, then fold back the alternating 2 thin strips and lay another thin strip down at an angle, as close to the parallel thick strip as possible. Repeat to create a tightly woven lattice that completely covers the pie.
Step 7
Trim the strips so they evenly extend about an inch past the bottom dough. Tuck the strips under the bottom dough so the folded-over dough extends a touch beyond the rim of the pie plate. Crimp the edges of the dough.
Step 8
Brush the cream all over the top of the dough and sprinkle with the sparkling sugar. Place the pie plate on the prepared sheet pan.
Step 9
Bake on the lowest oven rack for 20 minutes, then turn the oven temperature down to 350 degrees. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the fruit juices are thick and bubbling out in gaps in the lattice, about 1 hour 15 minutes. If you slide a metal cake tester or toothpick through one of those gaps, you shouldn’t feel much resistance from the fruit. Cool completely and serve.

cup/50 grams granulated sugar
¼
teaspoon ground turmeric
1½
cups/342 grams sour cream

Candied ginger, cut into thin slivers or pieces, for garnish","655 user ratings","1½ hours, plus chilling","Step 1
Make the crust: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9- or 9½-inch deep-dish pie plate. Mix the crumbs, sugar and salt in a large bowl (or pulse in a food processor if you’ve ground your own crumbs). Add the butter and mix (or pulse) until the mixture is well blended and feels like wet sand.
Step 2
Dump all of the crumbs into the pie plate and spread in an even layer. Firmly press against the sides, but not over the rim if there is one, to form a ¼-inch-thick edge. Firmly press the rest of the loose crumbs against the bottom. Bake until darker brown and dry and firm to the touch, 12 to 15 minutes. Turn the oven heat down to 325 degrees.
Step 3
While the crust bakes, make the filling: Beat the cream cheese with an electric stand or hand mixer until there are no tiny cream-cheese lumps. Add the sugar, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom and salt, and beat until very smooth, scraping the bowl if needed. Add the pumpkin and brandy (if using), and beat until fully incorporated, then beat in the eggs just until combined. You don’t want to beat the mixture too much once the eggs are added or your filling will balloon and then sink rather than bake evenly.
Step 4
Pour the filling into the crust (it’s OK if it’s hot, warm or cooled) and spread in an even layer. Bake until the edges are set, the entire top looks dry and the very center is just a bit jiggly, 45 to 50 minutes.
Step 5
After the cheesecake goes into the oven, make the topping: Mix the sugar and turmeric in a medium bowl, breaking up any clumps. Add the sour cream and stir gently until evenly tinted gold. Let sit at room temperature until ready to use.
Step 6
Carefully spread the topping over the hot baked filling in an even layer. Return to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack, then refrigerate uncovered until cold, at least 2 hours and up to 3 days. (Cover loosely with plastic wrap after 2 hours if you plan to chill it longer.)
Step 7
When ready to serve, decorate the top with the candied ginger.

Granny Smith or other tart green apples
¼

Make the crust: Pulse the sugar, salt and vanilla in a food processor until the sugar is evenly moistened. Add the flour and pulse until well blended. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
Step 2
Pour all the crumbs into a standard 9-inch pie dish. Gently sweep them into an even layer, then press the crumbs against the bottom and sides of the pan, forming a ¼-inch-thick edge. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. (The dough can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days before baking.)
Step 3
Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Use a fork to poke holes in the bottom of the chilled crust, patting back any crumbs that come loose. Bake until the center is pale golden brown and the edges are golden brown, 20 to 23 minutes. The center should feel set but a bit soft. Don’t overbake or the crust will be tough after it cools. Cool completely on a rack.
Step 4
Make the caramel: Pour ¼ cup cold water into a large saucepan. Pour the sugar in the center of the pan (you don’t want any to touch the sides), then pour the corn syrup on top. Bring to a boil over medium heat without touching the mixture. Let it bubble until it turns golden. Swirl the pan so the color evens out and continue cooking until it’s dark amber. Turn off the heat. Immediately and carefully add the butter. The mixture will bubble up. Start whisking and carefully add the cream in a steady stream while whisking, then whisk in the salt.
Step 5
Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan. Turn the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally with a heatproof spatula, until the mixture is at the soft ball stage (240 degrees), about 8 minutes. If you don’t have a candy thermometer, fill a mug with ice water. After the mixture has boiled for 7 minutes, scoop a small spoonful and immerse it in the ice water. Let it sit for a few seconds to cool, fish it out and pop it in your mouth. It should form a ball and be soft and chewy. If it isn’t, repeat the test in a minute.
Step 6
Turn off the heat and stir just until the bubbles subside. In that minute or two, the caramel will continue to cook; you want it at 245 degrees. At that point, pour it into the cooled pie shell. Tilt the pan if needed to spread it evenly.
Step 7
Let stand at room temperature until firm and cool, or refrigerate to chill and set more quickly. The set caramel tart can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.
Step 8
Up to a few hours before serving, cut an apple into quarters or sixths, then slice out the stem and core. Cut the pieces crosswise into ⅛-inch-thick slices, using a mandoline if you have one, a sharp knife if you don’t. Squeeze a little lemon juice over all the slices, tossing to evenly and barely coat. Shingle the slices in rows on top of the chilled caramel. Slice the other apple if needed to cover the top.

"Butternut Squash Lasagna Pie","Basil,Butternut Squash,Coriander Seed,Cumin Seed,Feta,Garlic,Lasagna,Lasagna Noodle,Parmesan,Dinner,Lunch,Main Course,Fall,Vegetarian","Yield: 6 servings","For the Pie

¼ cup olive oil, plus more for greasing the pan
8
garlic cloves, roughly chopped
2
tablespoons tomato paste
1
tablespoon cumin seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar and pestle
1
tablespoon coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar and pestle

small butternut squash (about 1 ¾ pounds), peeled, halved, deseeded and cut into ⅛-inch-thick slices
8
ounces dried lasagna noodles, each roughly broken into 3 or 4 pieces

ounces baby spinach (10 lightly packed cups)
1

1
cup crumbled Greek feta

Heaping ½ cup finely grated Parmesan
For the Béchamel
3
tablespoons unsalted butter

⅓ cup all-purpose flour
1½
cups whole milk, plus more if needed
2
garlic cloves, minced

Fine sea salt
¼
cup finely grated Parmesan","1285 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Make the pie: Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-inch springform cake pan then line it with a piece of parchment paper large enough to cover the base and hang over the sides by a couple inches; set aside.
Step 2
Add the oil to a small frying pan and heat over medium-high. Once it’s hot, add the garlic and cook for about 1 minute, stirring until fragrant but not browned. Add the tomato paste, cumin, coriander and chile flakes and cook for 1 minute more, stirring often, until deeply red. Set aside to cool slightly, then add to a small food processor with the red peppers, sugar, ½ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper; blitz until smooth.
Step 3
Empty the mixture into a very large bowl and add the squash, lasagna sheets, spinach, basil, feta, Parmesan, 1¼ teaspoons salt and a good grind of pepper. Use your hands to make sure everything is nicely coated. Transfer this mixture to your lined cake pan, adding a third at a time and pressing lightly to ensure everything is even and compact. Using heavy-duty aluminum foil, wrap the cake pan all around until tightly sealed, place on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour.
Step 4
Toward the last 15 minutes of baking time, make the béchamel: Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking steadily, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it starts to smell like popcorn. Slowly pour in the milk ½ cup at a time, whisking with each addition until fully incorporated. Turn the heat down to medium then add the garlic and ¼ teaspoon salt. Use a spatula to stir and cook for 2 minutes, stirring to ensure the bottom doesn’t scorch, until nice and smooth. Off the heat, stir in the Parmesan. If the pie isn’t done, cover the top with a piece of parchment paper to prevent a skin from forming. The béchamel is easier to handle when warm; if needed, reheat gently with a splash of milk to loosen.
Step 5
After the pie has cooked for 1 hour, remove it from the oven and carefully unwrap the top foil and paper, crinkling it down and around the sides of the pan to expose the top. Spoon the béchamel on top, using a spatula to distribute it evenly over the surface. (Take care not to mix it with the base; you want the béchamel to remain white.)
Step 6
Turn the oven temperature up to 450 degrees, place the cake pan back on its baking sheet and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, rotating halfway through, until nicely browned on top. Set aside to cool for at least 15 minutes.
Step 7
Carefully release the pie from the springform pan, loosening the outer ring then using the parchment to help lift it onto a serving plate or board. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.

teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)

cups refried black beans, preferably homemade
2
ounces queso Cotija or queso fresco, crumbled, plus more for serving
3
cups vegetable oil, for frying

Crema and pico de gallo, for serving","37 user ratings","45 minutes, plus 30 minutes’ resting","Step 1
In a large bowl, knead the masa, chipilín, salt and 2 tablespoons water with your hands until the ingredients are well incorporated and the mixture is soft and pliable but doesn’t stick to your hands, 3 to 5 minutes. If it’s still dry or crumbly or if it sticks to your hands, add another tablespoon or 2 of water and continue to mix. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let the masa rest for 30 minutes.
Step 2
Cut and remove the zip-top from a 1-gallon freezer bag. Cut the sides of the bag, so that you have 2 square pieces of plastic. If you have a tortilla press, use it here and trim the sides of the bag to fit the flat surface of the press.
Step 3
Divide the dough into 10 balls about (1½ inch in diameter and about 50 grams apiece). Arrange on a sheet pan and keep covered with a damp kitchen towel while you press and fill the empanadas.
Step 4
Fill a Dutch oven or other heavy deep pot with oil so that it comes up about ¾ inch up the sides. Heat on high until the oil reaches a temperature of 400 degrees. (You may need to adjust the heat to maintain the temperature as you fry the empanadas.)
Step 5
Line the tortilla press, if using, with the cut plastic (or use a smooth, flat-bottomed skillet), and working with a ball at a time, press each portion of masa into a 6½-inch round and remove the top sheet of plastic. Arrange 2 tablespoons of beans (if using canned, use heaping tablespoons to use the whole can) in a line down the center of the masa, leaving about ½ inch of space between the edge of the masa and the filling. Top with a teaspoon of queso. Using the bottom piece of plastic to help you, fold the plastic in half so that the two sides of the masa close over the filling. Pinch the plastic just outside of where the edges of the masa come together to seal the empanada. Peel off the plastic and transfer empanada to a sheet pan. Repeat with remaining masa and filling.
Step 6
Using a metal spatula, lower a single empanada into the hot oil. Spoon hot oil over the top for about 15 seconds, to seal the top side. Continue cooking until the empanada is golden brown and crispy, about 90 seconds per side. Transfer to a wire rack and repeat with the remaining empanadas.
Step 7
Top warm empanadas with a drizzle of crema and a sprinkle of queso. Serve with pico de gallo alongside.
If you can’t find fresh masa, you can substitute masa harina, prepared per the manufacturer’s directions.

Prepare the soup: Heat olive oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high and cook chicken, skin side down, until deep golden brown, 4 to 8 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
Step 2
Add mushrooms to the same pot, arrange in an even layer and cook, undisturbed, for 3 minutes until browned. Toss and cook on the second side, undisturbed, for 2 minutes, until browned. Transfer to the bowl with the chicken. Add corn, onion, carrot and garlic to the pot. Season with 5 teaspoons salt and cook, stirring vegetables occasionally, until onion is beginning to brown, 7 to 10 minutes.
Step 3
Add squash, chicken, mushrooms and any accumulated juices, milk and 5 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to maintain a simmer and cook, occasionally stirring and skimming, until the chicken is tender and is almost falling off the bone, 45 to 55 minutes. (Soup should be cooked at a gentle simmer to prevent the milk from foaming on the surface.) Stir in squash blossoms and remove from heat. Season with salt, if necessary. Let sit 15 minutes before serving.
Step 4
Meanwhile, fry the tortilla strips: Heat vegetable oil in a Dutch oven or other heavy deep pot over high until very hot, about 375 degrees. Carefully add the chiles to the pan and fry, turning frequently, until they turn a deep brick-red color, about 15 seconds. Transfer to a paper towel-lined sheet pan, reserving the oil, which will now be seasoned with the flavor of the chiles.

Adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature and working in batches, fry the tortilla strips, stirring frequently, until deep golden brown and crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to the paper-towel lined sheet tray and sprinkle with salt. Continue with remaining tortilla strips.

"Tamales de Rajas con Queso (Poblano and Cheese Tamales)","Mexican,Project,Cherry Tomato,Chiles De Arbol,Cornmeal,Mozzarella,Poblano,Breakfast,Lunch,Snack,Main Course,Vegetarian","Yield: 10 tamales","For the Rajas Mixture
5
medium poblano chiles (626 grams)
1¼
cups extra-virgin olive oil
1
pint cherry tomatoes
1
medium white onion, thinly sliced
2
garlic cloves, finely grated
2
chiles de árbol, stemmed and crushed
For the Tamales
1
tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
3
pounds fresh, coarse grind corn masa for tamales, “unprepared” (see Tip, or use 4¼ cups masa harina)
1
pound fresh or thawed frozen banana leaves, washed and patted dry
4
ounces queso Oaxaca or mozzarella, torn or cut into ½-inch pieces","9 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Prepare the rajas mixture: Roast the chiles. To roast the chiles on a gas stove (see Tip for other methods), turn 3 of the burners to high and set 2 chiles poblanos on each of the 2 grates and the remaining chile on the third. Roast over the flames, turning them occasionally, until all sides are charred, about 4 minutes per side.
Step 2
Transfer the chiles to a large bowl, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and let the chiles steam for 15 minutes.
Step 3
Heat oil, tomatoes, onion, garlic and chiles de árbol in a medium saucepan over medium, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes and onion are very soft but still hold their shape and the oil is rapidly boiling, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and strain oil into a heatproof bowl. Set aside vegetables and oil until ready to use.
Step 4
Carefully remove the stems, then peel and remove seeds from each chile (use gloves if you have them — poblanos can be spicy – and don’t be tempted to rinse the peels off with water, which will wash off all of the flavor). Cut the chiles into ¼-inch-wide strips. Add the rajas to the tomato-onion mixture and gently stir to combine. Set aside until ready to use.
Step 5
Meanwhile, prepare the tamales: In a small measuring cup, stir salt into ¼ cup warm water until partly dissolved. In a large bowl, mix the masa, salt water and reserved tomato-onion oil with your hands until the mixture is shiny, smooth and easily spreadable, about 5 minutes. (It should be the consistency of thick cake frosting.) Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside.
Step 6
To assemble the tamales, unfold a banana leaf (it should be 2 to 3 feet long). If you have gas burners, heat 1 on high. Using tongs if necessary, hold the leaf at each end and very slowly move the leaf over the flame, allowing it to drag across the grates, leaving it in one place until you see light discoloring coming through the top. Continue moving the leaf very slowly over the burner until the entire leaf is lightly charred and smells very toasty and fragrant, about 3 to 7 seconds to see charring in one spot. Repeat with the remaining banana leaves. If you don’t have gas burners, unfold the leaves and place them in a large stockpot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 3 minutes to soften, then drain, cool and pat dry.
Step 7
Remove the tough center rib and cut the leaf into 12-inch-long pieces; reserve the scraps. The leaves will vary in width from 10 to 16 inches depending on the age and type of tree they came from. Ideally, you want a piece that’s at least 12 by 10 inches. If your leaves are narrow or have holes in them, you can double up and slightly offset the leaves to get the right length. Arrange the leaf so a long side is facing you. Measure out ½ cup (160 grams) of masa and place it onto the center of the leaf and shape into a 6-inch by 3-inch rectangle about ½-inch thick.
Step 8
Arrange ¼ cup of rajas mixture evenly over the top of the masa. Top with a few pieces of queso.
Step 9
Fold a long side of the leaf over the filling, then fold over the other long side to cover. Fold the 2 short ends over the seam side of the tamal. Set the tamal on a sheet pan seam- and fold-side down. Repeat to assemble the remaining tamales.
Step 10
Place a metal basket, steamer basket or rack insert into a tamal pot, stockpot or pasta pot. Fill with enough water so it comes up to just below the basket (you don’t want the water to touch the tamales). Line the bottom of the basket with half of the reserved banana leaf scraps to cover any exposed metal. Arrange and stack the tamales, seam-side down, in the basket. Cover the tamales with remaining banana leaf scraps.
Step 11
Cover the pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low to keep the water at a simmer and steam for 35 minutes, adding more water as needed to keep some liquid in the pot.
Step 12
Carefully remove a tamal and set aside to cool for 5 minutes. (If you don’t let the tamal rest before checking, the masa will stick to the leaf and appear gummy.) Unfold the leaf — if the masa sticks, it’s not ready. If it’s not ready, carefully refold and return the tamal to the pot. Cook for 5 minutes more, then check again. If the leaf peels back easily and no masa sticks, your tamales are done.
Step 13
Remove from the heat, uncover the pot and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.
If you are using fresh masa, look or ask for “unprepared” masa. “Prepared” masa has added lard and seasonings, but “unprepared” has only corn, water and lime, so you can control the amount of lard and seasoning.
If you can’t find fresh masa, you can substitute masa harina, prepared per the manufacturer’s directions.
To roast the chiles in the broiler, arrange a rack in the top position and heat the broiler to high. Set the poblanos on a sheet pan; position under the broiler, turning occasionally, until all sides are charred, for 2 to 4 minutes per side.
To roast the chiles on a grill, prepare a charcoal or gas grill for high heat. Set the poblanos directly on the grate and grill, using tongs to turn them as they char on all sides, about 4 minutes per side.

½
cup masa harina, cornmeal or all-purpose flour

Vegetable oil, for frying
5
large eggs, separated","67 user ratings","1 hours 30 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the roasted tomato salsa: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven; heat to 475 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil. Arrange the tomatoes and jalapeños on the prepared pan and roast until the skin of the tomatoes and jalapeños is dark brown in places and starting to peel away from the flesh, 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 2
Transfer the tomatoes and jalapeños to a blender; add the onion, the garlic and 2 teaspoons of salt; and purée until completely smooth. Transfer the salsa to a medium bowl, stir in the lime juice, and set aside (this can be made up to 8 hours in advance).
Step 3
Prepare the chiles rellenos: Using a very sharp paring knife or kitchen shears, make a 2-inch cut down the side of each of the chiles, starting at the widest part near the stem. Leave the stem intact. Carefully remove the pith and seeds from the inside and discard.
Step 4
Whisk orange juice, garlic, oregano, allspice and ½ teaspoon salt in a medium bowl until the salt has dissolved. Dip each of the anchos in the mixture, flipping and gently moving it around to coat the inside and out. Let sit in the marinade until softened, about 30 minutes (they will absorb the flavor of the marinade). Remove, shake off excess marinade and arrange chiles on a sheet tray. Carefully stuff each with a slice of panela. If you have large chiles, you may need more than 1 slice. Close the chiles and bring together their edges. Using a toothpick or small skewer, secure the edges so that the cheese doesn’t fall out.
Step 5
Place masa harina in a pie plate or on a plate with a high rim. Working with 1 chile at a time, dredge in masa harina, turning to coat and packing it into crevices. Shake to remove excess; return chiles to the sheet tray. Repeat with remaining chiles.
Step 6
Pour enough oil into a heavy medium-size pot with high sides, preferably cast-iron, so that it comes ¾ inch up the sides. Heat oil over high until it reaches 400 degrees (you will need to adjust the heat level to maintain this temperature while frying). Place yolks in a small bowl and use a fork to beat. Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat the egg whites and ¼ teaspoon salt on high speed until you get stiff peaks, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce speed to low, drizzle in yolks, and beat until no streaks of white remain. The mixture will deflate slightly and should be pale yellow and creamy.
Step 7
Working with 1 chile at a time, grab the chile by the stem and slide it into the batter, making sure that it is completely coated on all sides and up to the stem. Carefully lay the chile in the oil, point side first and away from you. (This way, if you drop the chile, the oil will splash away from you.) Use a heatproof metal spoon to baste the top of the chile with hot oil for about 20 seconds. This will seal the surface, and the batter will start to puff and turn very light golden. Fry until chiles are golden brown on both sides, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack set over paper towels to drain. Repeat with remaining chiles and batter.
Step 8
Remove the toothpicks. Serve the warm chiles rellenos topped with the roasted tomato salsa (warm or room temperature).

Roast chicken or turkey, for serving","114 user ratings","2 hours 15 minutes","Step 1
Prepare a grill for high heat, or place a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 475 degrees. (An outdoor grill is preferable. If you use an indoor oven, your kitchen will get very smoky, so keep the vent on and your windows open — and you might want to disable your smoke alarm.)
Step 2
On a sheet pan, grill or roast the chiles until completely black, slightly puffed and resembling charcoal, 10 to 15 minutes. (They will appear inedible, but this is an essential Mexican technique of incinerating an ingredient and then using the rinsing method — outlined in Step 3 — to remove any bitterness.) Set aside to cool.
Step 3
Transfer the cooled chiles to a large heavy pot, fill the pot with water and stir vigorously. Drain through a colander, discarding the water, and return the chiles to the pot. Repeat 2 more times. Cover the chiles with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat and let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. This step is critical. Drain through a colander, discard the water and set chiles aside until ready to use. Wipe the pot dry but no need to wash.
Step 4
Meanwhile, place the plantain half on a small rimmed baking sheet and roast at 475 degrees until the peel is very dark, 20 to 30 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle; remove and discard peel. Set aside until ready to use.
Step 5
Line a large cast-iron skillet with a sheet of foil and heat the skillet over high. Add the tomatoes, tomatillos, onion and garlic to the hot, foil-lined pan and cook, using tongs to turn occasionally, until everything is charred on all sides, about 3 minutes for the garlic, 6 to 8 minutes for the onion and tomatillos, and 8 to 10 minutes for the tomatoes. Transfer to a plate to cool. Once cool enough to handle, peel the garlic.
Step 6
Heat 1 tablespoon lard in the same large, heavy pot over medium-high and fry almonds, peanuts, canela, cloves, anise, allspice, peppercorns and pumpkin seeds, stirring occasionally, until browned and seeds begin to pop, about 2 minutes. Add raisins, sesame seeds, cumin, thyme, oregano and avocado leaf, and cook, stirring constantly, until raisins are puffed and herbs are beginning to toast and are very fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chiles, plantain, charred vegetables, tostadas, chicken stock and salt to the pot and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to maintain a low simmer and cook until the chiles and nuts smash easily when pressed on the side of the pot, 30 to 45 minutes. Remove from the heat and set the pot aside to cool slightly before blending.
Step 7
Working in batches if necessary, carefully blend the chile mixture and liquid until as smooth as possible. Transfer to a large bowl, stirring to combine each new addition.
Step 8
Rinse and dry the pot, set it over medium-high, and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons lard until very hot. Carefully but quickly, pour the blended mole into the hot lard and immediately cover; it will spit and sputter, so an apron and long sleeves are a good idea. After the bubbles have slowed, stir, scraping up any fried bits from the bottom of the pot. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered, stirring frequently, until the mole is glossy and the consistency of gravy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chocolate and remove from the heat. Continue to stir until the chocolate is completely melted. Taste and season with salt if desired.
Step 9
Serve over chicken and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.
The mole can be made 2 days in advance. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator, or freeze for up to 1 month. Reheat in a medium saucepan over medium, stirring frequently until heated through.

cups refried black beans

Sliced iceberg lettuce, chopped onion, chopped cilantro, crema and crumbled queso fresco, for serving","7 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the filling: Combine the chiles, oregano, coriander, cumin, bay leaf, peppercorns, salt and 2 cups water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover and reduce to a simmer. Cook until chiles are very tender, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a blender and purée until completely smooth. Set aside until ready to use.
Step 2
Meanwhile, fill a large pot with water and add the flor de jamaica. Vigorously stir for about 30 seconds to clean the flowers. Using a mesh strainer, lift the flowers out of the pot and discard the sandy water. Repeat with fresh water until you don’t feel any more sand at the bottom of the pot. Return jamaica to pot and add 4 cups water and canela. Bring to a boil over high heat, cover, reduce to a simmer and continue cooking until the jamaica are very tender, about 10 minutes. Strain through a fine mesh sieve and save the liquid (concentrated hibiscus tea) for cocktails or agua fresca. Transfer cooked jamaica back to the pot and rinse with cold water, jostling to thoroughly clean. Drain and discard water; squeeze out excess water.
Step 3
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high and cook jamaica, tossing occasionally, until steam has subsided and any liquid in the pan has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add sweet potato, onion and garlic, and cook, tossing occasionally, until edges of the jamaica are reddish brown and the onion is very tender, about 10 minutes more. Add chile purée and bring to a boil, cover, reduce to a simmer and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sweet potato is cooked through and the salsa has reduced and is slightly thickened, 25 to 30 minutes. Taste and add salt, if necessary.
Step 4
Prepare the gorditas: In a large bowl, knead the fresh masa, oil, salt and 1 tablespoon warm water until well incorporated and the mixture is soft and pliable but doesn’t stick to your hands, about 4 minutes. If the mixture is dry, crumbly or sticks to your hands, add a tablespoon or two of warm water and continue to mix. Cover and let sit for 30 minutes to rest.
Step 5
Divide the dough into 8 balls (about 98 grams each), keeping them covered with a damp towel.
Step 6
Cut and remove the zip-top from a 1-gallon freezer bag. Cut the sides of the bag, so that you have 2 square pieces of plastic. If you’re using a tortilla press, trim the sides of the bag to fit the flat surface of the press. Line the press with the cut plastic (or use a smooth, flat-bottomed skillet), and working with 1 ball at a time, press each portion of masa into a 5-inch round about ⅓-inch thick. Carefully peel off the plastic and transfer the disk to a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Step 7
Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium and cook the gordita until the center puffs slightly and the gordita is browned in spots, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Repeat with the remaining gorditas. Let sit 10 minutes to cool slightly before you split them.
Step 8
Insert a sharp paring knife into the edge of the warm gordita. Cut a pocket into the gordita, leaving it intact on the other side (similar to a pita bread) to prevent the filling from leaking out. Repeat with the remaining gorditas.
Step 9
Stuff the gorditas with a few tablespoons of beans spread evenly over the interior. Layer with ⅓ cup of the guiso de jamaica. Top with lettuce, onion, cilantro, crema and queso.
If you can’t find fresh masa, you can substitute masa harina, prepared per the manufacturer’s directions.

"Pescado Zarandeado (Grilled Fish With Chile-Citrus Sauce)","Mexican,Seafood,Achiote,Chiles De Arbol,Lime Juice,Orange Juice,Red Snapper,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 8 servings","2
tablespoons achiote paste
2 to 3
chiles chiltepines or chiles de árbol, lightly crushed (2 for medium, 3 for spicy)
5
teaspoons fresh lime juice
5
teaspoons fresh orange juice
1
garlic clove, finely grated
3
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1
tablespoon soy sauce, preferably dark
1
green bell pepper, stemmed and seeded, cut into ¼-inch slices
½
large red onion, cut into ¼-inch slices

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1
whole red snapper (about 3 pounds), scaled, cleaned (head removed) and butterflied (see Tip)

Warm tortillas de maíz, your favorite salsa, lime and orange wedges, sliced cucumber, sliced tomatoes, sliced avocado, sliced iceberg lettuce and sliced red onion, for serving","21 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Place the achiote in a medium bowl and, using a whisk, break the paste into small pieces. To the same bowl, add chiles, lime juice, orange juice and garlic and whisk until smooth, then whisk in 2 tablespoons of oil and the soy sauce until blended.
Step 2
Prepare a grill for medium heat. Scrub the grates clean and, using tongs and an old, clean kitchen towel, brush the grates with oil. Toss bell pepper and onion slices in the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill until lightly charred on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.
Step 3
Pat the skin side of the fish dry with paper towels (this will help keep the fish from sticking). Using a sharp knife, score the flesh side of the fish on a diagonal at 1-inch intervals and about ¼-inch deep. Season with salt and pepper. Generously brush the achiote mixture onto the flesh side of the fish, making sure to coat the entire surface and pushing it into the score marks. If you have a fish grilling basket, use it! (Alternatively, you can roast it in the oven. Place prepared fish on a rack set inside a rimmed sheet tray and roast at 475 degrees until lightly browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.)
Step 4
Grill the fish, skin-side down, until the skin is charred, 7 to 10 minutes. Carefully turn the fish over with a wide spatula; continue to cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until the flesh side has char marks and easily releases from the grate and the flesh flakes easily. Generously brush any remaining achiote mixture onto the flesh side of the fish and turn over again to grill the flesh side for about 1 minute to cook the achiote. Remove from the grill and place the fish flesh-side up on a platter. Arrange grilled vegetables on top of fish. Serve with tortillas, salsa, limes, oranges, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, lettuce and sliced red onion.
Ask your fishmonger to clean and butterfly the red snapper for you. If your market doesn’t have snapper, you could also use whole sea bass, trout or large branzino.

tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
1
small bunch thyme (about 10 sprigs)
1

large bunches scallions, whites and greens thinly sliced (about 2½ cups)
1
jalapeño, seeded (if desired) and coarsely chopped
4
large garlic cloves, finely chopped
1½
teaspoons ground cumin
1
tablespoon tomato paste
6
cups vegetable stock
¾
cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems, plus more for optional garnish
1
lemon","678 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 425 degrees and line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper.
Step 2
In a large bowl, combine cauliflower, 1 teaspoon salt, a large pinch of black pepper, ¾ teaspoon ground coriander, 3 tablespoons oil and half the thyme sprigs, tossing everything until well coated. Spread the cauliflower evenly across one of the prepared pans.
Step 3
Using the same bowl (no need to wash it first), combine halved tomatoes, 1 to 2 tablespoons of harissa (depending on how spicy your harissa is; taste it first), 2 tablespoons olive oil, a large pinch of salt and the remaining thyme sprigs, and toss gently until the tomatoes are well coated. Spread tomatoes on the other baking sheet, cut-side up.
Step 4
Place both sheet pans in the oven and roast for 20 minutes, then stir the cauliflower but not the tomatoes. Continue to roast until cauliflower is golden brown and tender, 15 to 20 minutes longer (35 to 40 minutes total roasting time). Transfer cauliflower pan to a rack, and discard thyme sprigs.
Step 5
Using tongs, gently flip tomatoes over so their cut sides are down. Using the tongs, pinch off the tomato skins – they should slip right off – and discard. Brush 1 to 2 more tablespoons of harissa onto tomatoes and continue to roast until shriveled and condensed, about 15 to 25 minutes (35 to 45 minutes total roasting time).
Step 6
While tomatoes are roasting, make the soup: In a large pot, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium. Add scallions (saving ¼ cup scallions for serving) and jalapeño, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and lightly colored, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add another 1 ½ teaspoons salt, black pepper to taste, cumin and tomato paste, and cook until tomato paste darkens and caramelizes, 2 to 3 minutes.
Step 7
Stir in roasted cauliflower and stock, and bring to a simmer. Cook, partly covered, over medium-low heat until all vegetables are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Turn off the heat. Using an immersion blender, purée the soup until smooth. (Alternatively, you can purée it in batches in a food processor or blender.)
Step 8
Transfer the roasted tomatoes into a mixing bowl and add cilantro. Using a Microplane or other fine grater, grate zest from about half the lemon into the bowl, then stir in ½ teaspoon coriander and reserved scallions.
Step 9
Using a fork or spoon, break up some of the tomatoes as you combine everything. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze a little into the tomatoes, then taste and add more salt and lemon juice as needed. It should taste well seasoned and a little tangy.
Step 10
To serve, squeeze in the juice from half the lemon. Taste and add salt, pepper and lemon if needed. Ladle soup into individual bowls and dollop harissa tomatoes on top; top with olive oil and more cilantro, if you like.

Salsa taquera, chopped white onion, chopped cilantro, sliced radishes and lime wedges, for serving","138 user ratings","4 hours ","Step 1
Heat lard in a large heavy pot over medium-high and cook brisket until browned on all sides, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer brisket to a large bowl. Add pork belly to the pot and cook until browned on at least two sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to bowl with brisket. Add pig’s foot and cook until browned on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes. Add salt, reserved brisket and pork belly, their accumulated juices and 2½ cups water. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce to a low simmer and cook for 1½ hours. Brisket and pork will be partly cooked and very tough at this point. Add chorizo links, spring onions and garlic, cover and continue to simmer until meats are all very tender and will shred easily with little resistance, another 1 to 1½ hours.
Step 2
When ready to assemble, remove pig’s foot from pot (be careful not to leave behind any bones) and separate meat and skin from bones. Discard bones, chop the meat and skin, and transfer to a large bowl. Chop the brisket, pork belly, chorizo and spring onion and add them, along with the garlic, to the bowl with the pig’s foot; toss to combine. Pour cooking liquid over meat.
Step 3
Spoon meat and some juices onto a tortilla and top with salsa taquera, onion, cilantro, radish and a squeeze of lime. Or make taqueria-style tacos (see Tip).
Meat can be cooked and stored, uncut, in the cooking liquid for up to 3 days. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
To make taqueria-style tacos, heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Lightly dip a tortilla in the oil floating above the chopped meat, and transfer to the skillet, dipped side down. If necessary, use tongs or a spatula to move the tortilla around the skillet to coat the surface of the tortilla in oil. Flip and heat the second side until very lightly browned in spots. Repeat with remaining tortillas. To the same hot skillet, add 2 cups of the chopped meat mixture with some of the oil in an even layer and fry, tossing or stirring frequently until the meat is browned and lightly crisped on the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve immediately with the warmed tortillas.

1
Scotch bonnet or habanero chile
3
thyme sprigs
1
cup all-purpose flour

Cooked rice, for serving","224 user ratings","3 hours, plus overnight soaking","Step 1
Rinse your peas, then soak them in a large pot of cold water in the refrigerator overnight or for at least 8 hours. Rinse the chopped pig's tail, if using, and soak in a bowl of cold water in the refrigerator overnight or for at least 8 hours. (If using beef, salt your chunks right before cooking.)
Step 2
Pour out water from the soaked peas, leaving the peas in the pot, then add garlic, scallions and drained pig’s tail or salted beef. Refill with water until everything is just covered. Bring to a simmer, then stir in coconut milk. Continue simmering for at least 2½ hours, until meat is fork tender and peas are cooked through, skimming any foam that rises and replenishing with water as needed to keep solids covered.
Step 3
Add chile and thyme. Continue simmering for 30 minutes, adjusting the seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 4
While peas are stewing, form your spinners: In a medium bowl, stir flour and a pinch of salt. Then add ¼ cup water, stirring with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. If the dough seems too dry and doesn’t come together, stir in more water, a teaspoon at a time. Pinch off a tablespoon’s worth of dough, and roll it in the palms of your hands to form a thin dumpling (about 5 inches long and scant ½ inch in diameter). Set aside, then repeat, spacing the spinners apart and continuing until you’ve used all of the dough.
Step 5
Fifteen minutes before serving, add spinners to the pot of stew peas, stirring them into the dish. Simmer until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove the pot from heat. Serve stew peas hot with white rice.

4
ounces skinless cod fillet, cut into ¼-inch cubes
½
teaspoon smoked paprika

Salt and black pepper
10
large eggs
⅓
cup mayonnaise","422 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat oil over medium until shimmering. (A potato dropped into the oil should sizzle.) Add potatoes, leeks and 2 teaspoons of the garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender in the center and golden in spots, about 15 minutes. The mixture should be at a brisk simmer and completely submerged in the oil. (After a few minutes, the vegetables will soften and shrink.) Set a strainer over a heatproof bowl and drain the potato mixture; reserve the infused cooking oil. Wipe out the skillet.
Step 2
While the potato mixture cooks, combine cod and paprika in a small bowl; season with salt and pepper, and mix well.
Step 3
Once the potato mixture is drained, beat the eggs in a large bowl. Add potato mixture, season with salt and pepper, and mix until well blended; fold in cod.
Step 4
In the skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil over medium-low. Add the egg mixture and cook, using a spatula to pull in the set edges and allow liquid to flow out, about 2 minutes. Cook until eggs are set around the edges but still slightly runny in the center, about 3 minutes longer.
Step 5
Using oven mitts or kitchen towels and a plate that is larger than the skillet, place the plate over the skillet and carefully flip the skillet to invert the tortilla onto the plate. Heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved oil in the skillet over medium and slide the tortilla back into the skillet, cooked side up. Cook until golden underneath and center is just set, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Slide out the tortilla onto a serving platter.

For the (optional) Glaze
1
cup/100 grams confectioners’ sugar
4 to 6
teaspoons orange juice

Pinch salt","683 user ratings","35 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
Zest the orange into a large bowl. (You should have about 2 teaspoons of zest.) Reserve the remaining orange for the glaze. Add the ¼ cup granulated sugar to the zest and use your fingers to rub the zest into the sugar. The mixture will be very moist and fragrant. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and whisk to combine.
Step 3
Add the butter to the bowl and toss to coat in flour. Use your fingers or a pastry blender to work the butter into the flour until it is the size of small peas. Add the cranberries and stir to combine. Make a well in the center of the mixture and add the buttermilk and cream. Use a fork to gently stir the mixture into a shaggy dough. (It’s OK if there are a few loose, floury pieces of dough.)
Step 4
Dump the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat it into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Fold the dough in half then pat it into a rectangle again and fold it one more time. Pat the dough into a square that is about 7 inches wide and 1 inch thick, then cut it into 9 pieces. Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet, brush the tops of the scones with a bit of cream and sprinkle with more granulated sugar.
Step 5
Bake scones until golden brown and cooked through, 18 to 22 minutes.
Step 6
While the scones are baking, make the glaze, if desired: Juice the orange. Add the confectioners’ sugar, 4 teaspoons of orange juice and a pinch of salt to a bowl. Whisk until smooth, adding more juice as needed to make a thick, but pourable glaze.
Step 7
Let the scones cool for about 15 minutes, then drizzle or brush the glaze over the scones. These are best the first day, but you can store any leftover scones in an airtight container for a day or two. They also keep well in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.

If you’d like to give your meat a smoky flavor, you can smoke it for an hour or so in a charcoal grill set up for indirect grilling with wood chips strewn over the coals. Then, transfer it to a Dutch oven or pot, cover and bake as directed below.
Step 4
If you’re not smoking your meat, you can cook it in the oven from start to finish. About 4 hours before you want to eat, heat the oven to 425 degrees. Take the pork out of the refrigerator and let stand while the oven heats. Uncover the meat. Set it fat side up, transferring it to a Dutch oven or pot if needed. Scatter the onion around the meat and sprinkle with salt. Drizzle the oil all over the meat and onion.
Step 5
Roast until the onion browns and the pork fat crackles a bit, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, snap the stems off the chiles and discard them, then snap the chiles in half. Shake out their seeds and discard them.
Step 6
Drop the chiles on top of the onion. Add 2½ cups water, cover the pot and reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees. Cook until the meat is tender enough to fall apart when speared with a fork, about 3½ hours.
Step 7
Transfer the pork to a sheet pan. If you’d like the meat to have crispy charred bits, heat the broiler. Broil the pork until deeply browned in spots but try not to burn it. It will still be very tasty if you skip this broiling step. While the pork broils or rests, stir the vinegar into the hot cooking liquid in the pot. If you’d like, you can skim the fat off the surface of the cooking liquid. Transfer everything in the pot to a blender and blend until very smooth. Taste and add more sugar, vinegar and salt, if you’d like.
Step 8
Slide the pork back into the pot and shred with two forks. Pour enough of the sauce over the meat to evenly coat and stir to combine. If the mixture has cooled, heat it over low until simmering. Serve hot, with any extra sauce on the side. This dish keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for up to 3 months. Reheat, stirring now and then, in a microwave or over medium-low heat on the stovetop.

"Beet Salad With Goat Cheese Toasts","Beet,Fennel,Goat Cheese,Party,Salad,Dinner,Appetizer,Fall,Vegetarian","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","4
medium golden beets (the size of a tennis ball), trimmed and scrubbed

Salt and pepper
1
small shallot, minced
1
small garlic clove, grated
3
tablespoons sherry vinegar, plus more as needed
½
cup extra-virgin olive oil
½
teaspoon chopped thyme
½
teaspoon chopped rosemary
½
teaspoon finely sliced chives
½
teaspoon lemon zest
4
ounces fresh goat cheese, at room temperature
8 to 10
thin slices of baguette
1
medium fennel bulb, trimmed","176 user ratings","1 hour 30 minutes","Step 1
Cook beets: Place the beets in a small roasting dish, add water to a depth of about 1 inch and a generous pinch of salt. Cover tightly and bake at 375 degrees for about 1 hour, until beets can be pierced with a fork. (Alternatively, simmer beets on the stovetop for an hour in well-salted water.)
Step 2
Let cool slightly, then slip off skins while the beets are still warm. Cut beets into wedges and place in a small bowl. Beets may be cooked up to 2 days in advance.
Step 3
While the beets roast, make the vinaigrette: Place shallot and garlic in a small bowl or jar. Cover with vinegar and add a pinch of salt. Whisk in olive oil and add pepper.
Step 4
Prepare goat cheese: With a fork, stir herbs and lemon zest into goat cheese. Spread goat cheese mixture on baguette slices and set on a baking sheet. When ready to serve, bake until crisp and slightly browned, 10 minutes in a 375-degree oven or toaster oven. Toasts do not have to be piping hot when served.
Step 5
Whisk dressing and pour over beets, reserving 3 tablespoons. Add a pinch of salt and toss beets well. Leave to sit for a few minutes, then taste and adjust vinegar and salt — beets are notorious for needing more vinegar and salt.
Step 6
Thinly slice the fennel crosswise. Toss with a little salt and the reserved dressing. Arrange fennel on individual plates or a serving dish. Place dressed beets on fennel, then fluff fennel a bit. Garnish with goat cheese toasts and serve.

tablespoons unsalted butter
2
tablespoons finely chopped shallots, yellow onion or scallions

About 4½ cups corn kernels (see Tip)

cup half-and-half, plus more as needed

Pinch of cayenne or 1 teaspoon thyme leaves (optional)

Salt and pepper

Grated Parmesan or chopped parsley, chives or tarragon (optional), for serving","148 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
In a large pot, heat the butter over medium. When melted, add the shallots and cook until softened, 1 to 3 minutes. Add the corn, half-and-half and cayenne or thyme, if using; stir to combine. When you see bubbles around the edge of the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the corn is tender, 5 to 10 minutes for frozen and canned corn and 10 to 15 minutes for fresh corn. (Do not add salt yet; it will toughen the corn.) Remove from heat.
Step 2
Transfer a third of the corn (about 1 cup) to a blender and blend until very smooth. (Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of half-and-half to get things moving in the blender, if necessary.) Stir the purée back into the corn mixture. If the creamed corn is too loose, simmer uncovered over medium-low until thickened. If the creamed corn is too tight, thin with more half-and-half.
Step 3
Season to taste with salt and pepper, then top with serving additions, if desired.
For 4 ½ cups corn kernels, use 30 ounces frozen, thawed corn; 3 (15-ounce) cans of corn, drained; or kernels from 4 to 6 ears (scrape the cobs with the back of a knife to retrieve the milky juices).

6
ounces aged white Cheddar, chopped or sliced into bite-size pieces
¼
cup chopped parsley
2
small or medium heads butter lettuce, leaves torn (about 6 loosely packed cups)","383 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan or pot over medium until the oil is hot enough to make a sample sage leave sizzle immediately, about 3 minutes. Working in batches, place the sage leaves in the hot oil, moving them with a fork or spoon to help them fry evenly, and cook until the oil stops bubbling and leaves crisp up, about 1 minute. Transfer the sage leaves to a paper-towel-lined plate and season with salt and pepper; repeat with remaining sage leaves.
Step 2
Remove the saucepan from the heat then stir in the honey and Dijon mustard until combined; set aside to cool.
Step 3
Mix the lemon juice and shallot together in a large bowl. Slice the apples into ¼-inch wedges, toss with the shallot and lemon juice and season with ½ teaspoon salt. Add the Cheddar and parsley and toss to coat.
Step 4
Once the sage-honey oil has cooled until just warm, pour into the bowl with the apples and Cheddar, toss well to coat. Gently fold in the lettuce. The Cheddar and apples will be pesky and fall to the bottom of the bowl, but scoop as much as you can to arrange them on top of the lettuce. Top with whole or crushed sage leaves and serve immediately.

large sheet banana leaf (from a 1-pound package), optional
9
tablespoons/128 grams unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing pans
1½
cups/355 milliliters unsweetened coconut cream
2
large eggs
1
cup/200 grams superfine (caster) sugar
2
cups/250 grams self-rising flour
1
cup macapuno (coconut sport), optional (see Tip)","67 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Wash and dry the banana leaf, if using. Cut into 24 5-inch squares and use the squares to line 2 (12-cup) standard muffin tins. If not using banana leaf, drizzle a little melted butter in each muffin cup and coat the cups with it.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk together the 9 tablespoons of melted butter and half the coconut cream. In a separate, larger mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the superfine sugar until lighter in color.
Step 3
Sift the flour into a medium bowl. Add about a third of the flour to the eggs and fold in by gently running a flexible spatula through and around the mixture until everything is combined. Then, fold in a third of the coconut cream mixture. Alternate folding in the flour and the coconut cream, making sure not to overmix and ending with the coconut cream.
Step 4
Divide the batter among the muffin cups. Bake for 6 to 8 minutes, until set along the circumference but still loose at the center. Take the tins out of the oven and raise the temperature to 375 degrees. Top each cake with a couple strands of macapuno, if using (see Tip).
Step 5
Return the tins to the oven and bake for another 4 to 7 minutes, until golden at the edges and springy at the center when lightly pressed. Cool and serve.
Macapuno, also labeled as coconut sport or coconut strings, is the jellylike flesh of prized mutant coconuts, and can be found in Asian grocery stores and online. If you are not using it, you can instead sprinkle each cake with an even coating of toasted unsweetened shredded coconut and granulated sugar before baking, if you wish.

Place a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray an 8-inch square or 9-inch round baking pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper.
Step 2
Make the streusel: In a small bowl, combine the sugar, flour, pumpkin spice and salt. Add the butter, then pinch the butter into the flour mixture with your fingertips until the mixture forms pebble-size crumbs and is evenly moistened.
Step 3
Make the cake: In a large bowl, whisk the sugar and eggs until pale and foamy, about 1 minute. Add the pumpkin purée, melted butter, oil, pumpkin spice and salt; whisk until combined and smooth. Whisk in the baking powder and baking soda, then whisk in the flour.
Step 4
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan, smooth the top and tap on the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles. Sprinkle the streusel evenly over the top.
Step 5
Bake the cake until puffed and golden, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Set the cake in the pan on a rack to cool. After about 15 minutes remove the cake from the pan and set it on the rack to cool almost completely.
Step 6
When the cake is just slightly warm, make the glaze, if using: Add the confectioners’ sugar, pumpkin spice, pinch of salt and 3 teaspoons of milk to a bowl. Whisk until smooth, adding a bit more milk as necessary to form a glaze that is very thick but can be drizzled.
Step 7
Drizzle the glaze over the top of the cake.
Make your own pumpkin spice blend by combining 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon, 1 tablespoon ground ginger, 1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg, 1 teaspoon ground cardamom, ½ teaspoon ground allspice and ¼ teaspoon ground cloves. Makes about ¼ cup.

1
tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, plus more for serving
1
tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Kosher)
1
teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper","1181 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Prepare the sauce: Tear 5 basil leaves in half; reserve the rest. Combine the torn basil, olive oil, garlic and red-pepper flakes (if using) in a small saucepan and cook over very low heat for 10 minutes, allowing the basil and garlic to steep in the oil. (Do not let the garlic get beyond medium brown in color.) Remove from the heat, strain the oil, discard the solids and set the infused oil aside.
Step 2
In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt and pepper with 2 cups water and the infused oil. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately reduce to a simmer.
Step 3
Partially cover the pot and simmer the sauce over medium-low heat, undisturbed, while you prepare the ricotta polpette.
Step 4
In a large bowl, use a spatula to mix all the polpette ingredients until combined. (The mixture will be quite soft.) Wet your hands and pinch off approximately 2-tablespoon portions and roll them into balls between your palms. (They should each be about 2 inches wide and weigh about 40 grams.) Place each polpette on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining mixture, making about 35 small balls.
Step 5
Once all the polpette have been rolled, bring the sauce to a boil and carefully drop them into the sauce. Shimmy the pot back and forth gently, after each addition, to make room and to prevent the polpette from sticking to the bottom of the pot or to each other. Do not stir, as the balls will break apart.
Step 6
Cover the pot with a lid and leave the polpette in the sauce, undisturbed, for 4 minutes. Remove the lid and shimmy the pot again. They will have begun to firm up. Cover the pot again and cook for another 10 minutes, until they are firm, plump and cooked through.
Step 7
Carefully remove the polpette to a plate, topping them with spoonfuls of sauce, or transfer the polpette and sauce to a shallow serving bowl. Chop the remaining basil and sprinkle on top, and garnish with more grated cheese.
This recipe uses the packaged ricotta cheese widely available in most supermarkets, but if you would like to use fresh ricotta from an Italian market, reduce the bread crumbs needed by a half cup, since fresh ricotta is strained and is packaged with less moisture.

In a food processor, combine scallions, garlic and cilantro; pulse until finely chopped, scraping down sides of bowl. Add two-thirds of the shrimp, along with the egg white, soy sauce and sesame oil; pulse until a coarse paste forms, scraping down sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Transfer the shrimp paste to a medium bowl. Chop the remaining shrimp into ¼-inch pieces and add to the bowl; season with salt and pepper, and mix well. (The mixture will be quite moist and spreadable.)
Step 2
Set the sesame seeds on a large plate. Spread one-quarter of the shrimp mixture in an even layer on one slice of bread; repeat with the remaining shrimp mixture and bread. Working with one slice of bread at a time, invert it into the sesame seeds, shrimp side down, and gently press so seeds adhere. Transfer to a cutting board, setting each piece sesame side up. Cut each slice of bread diagonally into 4 triangles.
Step 3
In a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet, heat ¼ inch of oil over medium until shimmering. (A small piece of bread dropped into the oil should sizzle when the oil is properly preheated.) Working in 2 batches, add the triangles, shrimp side down, in a single layer and fry until golden and crispy underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip toasts and fry until shrimp is cooked through and bread is golden brown and crispy underneath, 1½ to 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.

1½
cups/9 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips","962 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
In a small (preferably light-colored) saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue cooking, stirring constantly to prevent the milk solids from burning, until the butter foams, darkens into a light amber color and becomes fragrant and nutty, about 3 to 4 minutes more. (Watch closely to make sure the butter doesn't burn.) Immediately pour the butter along with any of the browned milk solids into a large heatproof mixing bowl. Let cool for 20 minutes until warm but no longer hot.
Step 2
While the butter cools, heat the oven to 325 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch metal or glass baking pan with cooking spray or oil and line with a strip of parchment paper that hangs over the two long sides to create a sling.
Step 3
Add the brown sugar, pumpkin purée and vanilla extract to the cooled butter and whisk until smooth and glossy. Add the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, salt, ginger, cloves and nutmeg and stir with a spatula just until a soft dough forms with no pockets of unincorporated flour. (Try not to overmix.) Add 1¼ cups/216 grams of the chocolate chips and stir to evenly distribute throughout the dough.
Step 4
Transfer the dough to the prepared baking pan and press into an even layer using a spatula or clean hands coated with nonstick spray or oil. Sprinkle the top with the remaining chocolate chips, pressing them in so they stick. Bake until the bars are puffed, the top is lightly browned and a skewer or knife inserted into the center comes out clean with just a few moist crumbs attached or with smudges of melted chocolate, 30 to 45 minutes.
Step 5
Let the bars cool in the pan on a wire rack for at least 1 hour. Using the parchment paper, lift the bars out of the pan and cut into 24 squares. The cookie bars will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.

cups/350 milliliters heavy cream
1½
cups/300 grams granulated sugar
10
egg yolks, room temperature
½
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
2½
cups/625 milliliters whole milk","96 user ratings","2 hours, plus chilling","Step 1
Place a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the sweet hawaij and toast, stirring often, until the spices become fragrant and darken slightly in color, about 30 seconds. Keep the heat on medium and pour in the heavy cream. Heat the cream, stirring occasionally, until steam begins to rise from the surface, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat and allow the spices to steep, about 10 minutes.
Step 2
Set out a 9-inch round cake pan. Heat a separate small saucepan over medium until a drop of water sizzles on the surface. Reduce heat to medium-low. Make a dry caramel by adding ¾ cup/150 grams sugar to the pan in an even layer. The sugar will gradually begin melting into a syrup. If it browns immediately, your pan is too hot and the heat should be turned down to low. Allow the sugar to melt, stirring in any dry spots with a heat-safe spatula, about 2 minutes. As the crystals melt, the syrup will change color from light to golden brown, about another 4 minutes. Once the sugar has melted, continue to stir and cook the syrup until it’s a light amber color and smoke begins to rise from the surface of the caramel, 2 minutes more. Immediately pour the caramel into the bottom of the cake pan and swirl the pan to evenly coat it with caramel. Allow the caramel to cool completely.
Step 3
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Prepare a water bath in a large roasting pan by filling it a third of the way up with room-temperature water. Place the roasting pan in the middle rack of the oven as it heats.
Step 4
In a medium bowl, use a whisk to gently combine the egg yolks and remaining ¾ cup/150 grams granulated sugar. Add the salt and pour in the steeped heavy cream while gently stirring. (You want to incorporate as little air as possible, so be careful not to whisk too hard.) Add the milk, then pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve. You can do this directly into the pan with the caramel, keeping the sieve just above the pan to minimize bubbles on the surface of the custard.
Step 5
Transfer the pan to the water bath and cover the entire pan and water bath with aluminum foil. Bake for 50 minutes. The edges of the custard will just be starting to set and the center will still jiggle loosely at this point when the pan is moved back and forth. Remove the foil and bake until the custard is set and the center jiggles only slightly when the pan is moved back and forth, 20 to 25 minutes more.
Step 6
Remove the pan from the water bath and let cool to room temperature. Move to the refrigerator and cool completely until the custard is set and firm, 8 to 12 hours. To serve, run a knife along the edges of the custard to loosen. To loosen the bottom, place the pan on a warm kitchen towel for about 30 seconds. Put a serving platter (large enough to hold the custard and caramel sauce) on top of the pan and invert: Be confident and do this action in one fluid motion without hesitating. The custard should slip easily onto the serving platter with the caramel sauce pooling nicely around it.
For the ground sweet hawaij blend, you can buy a pre mixed blend or make your own by combining 1 teaspoon ground ginger, ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon ground cardamom, ⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg and ⅛ teaspoon ground clove.

1
cup cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered if large
2
tablespoons capers, drained
1
cup torn fresh basil or parsley
1
lemon, zested and halved","134 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Place eggplant in a bowl and sprinkle all over with salt; set aside.
Step 2
In a pot of well-salted water, cook pasta according to the package directions until about 1 minute shy of al dente. Drain well, reserving some of the pasta water (about ⅔ cup is plenty). Lightly drizzle pasta with olive oil to prevent from sticking together.
Step 3
Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm ¼ cup olive oil. Stir in about a quarter of the chopped anchovies and all of the grated garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in bread crumbs and sauté until golden, 2 to 3 minutes. Season with a few grinds of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Scrape into a small bowl and set aside.
Step 4
Wipe out skillet (no need to wash it). Add ¼ cup olive oil and put it back over medium-high heat until oil thins out in the pan. Add enough eggplant to fit in one layer without overlapping. Without moving them around too much, cook eggplant until brown on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir and let them cook on the other side until browned and thoroughly soft, 3 to 7 minutes more. Use a slotted spoon to transfer eggplant to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining eggplant, adding more oil to the pan as needed.
Step 5
Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet and stir in remaining anchovies, the sliced garlic and red-pepper flakes. Cook over medium heat until garlic is pale gold at the edges (don’t let the garlic turn brown), 1 to 3 minutes.
Step 6
Stir in tomatoes and capers. Cook until tomatoes just begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Add eggplant, pasta and ¼ cup pasta water. Toss well, adding more pasta water if the mixture looks dry.
Step 7
Stir in basil and lemon zest. Squeeze half a lemon all over the pasta and toss. Taste and add more red-pepper flakes, salt or lemon juice to taste. Generously sprinkle bread crumbs on top of pasta and serve hot, warm or at room temperature.

Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, mix ½ cup feta with half the chopped mint, plus the oats, yogurt, oregano, red-pepper flakes and 1 teaspoon salt, breaking up any lingering feta chunks with your hands. Add the chicken, gently combining until it’s lightly speckled with green dots.
Step 2
Drizzle the oil on a sheet pan and use your hands to spread it around. Use your oiled palms to shape the chicken into 1- to 1¼-inch loosely firm but not compact balls; lightly roll them in the oil on the sheet pan when shaping to coat them and prevent them from sticking. You should have 18 to 20 meatballs. Once the meatballs have all been rolled out, spread them out evenly on the sheet pan.

In a large stock pot, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring frequently until softened and just beginning to brown around the edges, about 4 minutes. Stir in the chile and pumpkin purée, and whisk in the water or stock. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and allow to simmer on low, giving an occasional stir, for 20 minutes or until slightly reduced and thickened. Remove the chile after the soup simmers if you don’t care for much spice.
Step 2
Add coconut milk, agave or honey (if using), and peanut butter to the pot. Using an immersion blender or working in batches in a standing blender, purée the soup until smooth. Season with salt and keep warm over low heat. Do not bring soup up to a simmer or boil at this point. (This reduces the risk of the oils in the peanut butter separating and breaking the soup's smooth texture.)
Step 3
Divide soup between bowls, sprinkle with the chives and a dollop of crème fraîche or yogurt, or a drizzle of olive oil to make it vegan. Serve with a warm crusty baguette or chunks of warm sourdough for dipping.

"Gochugaru Salmon With Crispy Rice","Seafood,Gochugaru,Maple Syrup,Rice,Salmon Fillet,Dinner,Quick,Weeknight,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","4
skin-on salmon fillets (6 ounces each)

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
1
tablespoon olive oil
4
cups cooked white rice, preferably leftovers
4
teaspoons gochugaru (see Tip)
2
tablespoons maple syrup
2
tablespoons rice vinegar
2
tablespoons cold, unsalted butter, kept whole

Sliced cucumbers or pickles, for serving (optional)","2844 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Season the salmon on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add the olive oil and sear the salmon fillets skin side down until the skin is browned and crispy, 2 to 5 minutes. The salmon’s orange flesh will begin to turn pale coral as the heat slowly creeps up the sides of the fish; you want that coral color to come up about two-thirds of the way at this point for a nice medium-rare. Carefully flip the salmon and cook the second side until the flesh feels firm, another 1 to 2 minutes. When you press it, it should not feel wobbly. Transfer the salmon to a plate skin side down and keep the pan with the rendered fat over the heat.
Step 2
Add the rice to the fat in the pan and spread in an even layer, packing it down as if making a rice pancake. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the bottom is lightly browned and toasted, about 5 minutes. You should hear it crackle. Flip the rice like a pancake, using a spatula if needed. You may not be able to flip it all in one piece, but that’s OK. Cook until lightly toasted on the second side, another 1 to 2 minutes. Go longer if you want crispier rice, but the trifecta of crispy-chewy-soft tastes wonderful.
Step 3
While the rice is cooking, stir together the gochugaru, maple syrup, rice vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. When the rice is done, divide it evenly among the plates. In the now-empty pan, add the gochugaru mixture and cook, stirring constantly, over medium-high heat until it bubbles up and reduces significantly, 15 seconds to 1 minute. It should look pretty sticky. Turn off the heat and add the cold butter, stirring with a wooden spoon or tongs until fully melted and incorporated into the gochugaru mixture. Pour this glaze over the salmon and serve with cucumbers or pickles, if you’d like.
You can find gochugaru, or red-pepper powder, at Korean or Asian supermarkets and at most grocery stores, as well as online. It sometimes comes in larger bags, which is not a problem because it freezes beautifully and tastes great dusted over just about anything.

"Pernil","Meat,Garlic,Plan Ahead,Pork Shoulder,Puerto Rican,Dinner,Main Course,Christmas,Thanksgiving","Yield: 8 to 10 servings","For the Adobo (see Notes)
8 to 9
large garlic cloves, finely minced
3
tablespoons olive oil
5
teaspoons fresh sour orange juice (or equal parts lime and orange juice)
4
teaspoons dried oregano
8 to 9
teaspoons kosher salt
1
teaspoon black pepper
For the Pork Shoulder
1
(8- to 9-pound) bone-in, skin-on pork shoulder, preferably with skin covering the entire top layer
1
teaspoon kosher salt","1501 user ratings","3 to 4 hours, plus marinating","Step 1
Prepare the adobo by combining all the ingredients and grinding in a large pilón or mortar and pestle, or simply mixing together well in a small bowl.
Step 2
Prepare the pork: Rinse and dry meat well with a clean towel. Place pork skin-side down on a large rimmed sheet pan and poke deep, 1-inch holes throughout the meat and in the fatty layer with a paring knife, being careful not to pierce the skin. You can’t have too many holes.
Step 3
Pour over adobo in batches, using your fingers to push adobo deep into the meat. If you’re worried about your hands smelling like garlic — which they will! — wear gloves.
Step 4
Set out a long sheet of plastic wrap, layering with subsequent sheets as needed to ensure you can securely wrap the entire pork shoulder. Transfer pork to plastic wrap and wrap tightly, adding sheets of plastic as needed to ensure pork is completely airtight and juices are contained. Let marinate in the fridge overnight if possible, or at least least 2 to 3 hours. Set on a rimmed baking sheet or disposable aluminum foil pan in case it leaks.
Step 5
Once the pork has marinated, heat oven to 400 degrees. Working over the sink, carefully remove pork from plastic wrap, discarding any remaining adobo. Place the marinated pork shoulder skin-side up in a deep roasting pan, and wipe the skin with a clean cloth. Rub skin with 1 teaspoon salt.
Step 6
Loosely tent foil over the pork shoulder, spraying the foil with cooking spray or brushing with oil in any areas that may touch the skin, as it will stick. Transfer to the center of the oven.
Step 7
Roast in the oven for 1 hour, then carefully remove the foil and rotate the pan. Continue roasting for another 2 to 3 hours, rotating every hour or so, and watching closely. Add water to the pan as needed when juices evaporate. The meat is done cooking when the juices run clear and the thickest part of the shoulder registers 160 degrees with a meat thermometer. The skin may take more time to crisp, but watch closely so that it does not burn. Tap the top of the skin with the back of a knife or metal spatula, and listen for a decidedly hollow sound.
Step 8
Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes, then transfer to a large cutting board. (For cleaning instructions for the pan, see Notes.) If desired, remove the skin from the roast by slicing it along the underside of the bone with a long, sharp, slender knife. Run the knife underneath the skin starting from the bottom until loosened, then lift the skin from the meat. Use kitchen shears to cut into serving pieces, and let them rest in the warm oven until ready to eat. Trim excess fat from the meat if desired, and slice as desired, in large chunks or slices, to serve.
You can use a smaller or larger pork shoulder, but calculate your adobo accordingly by using the following formula per pound of meat: 1 large garlic clove, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, ½ teaspoon sour orange juice, ½ teaspoon dried oregano and ⅛ teaspoon black pepper. If using a smaller pork shoulder, you may want to reduce the amount of salt slightly.
Use a pan that can handle char. You can line your pan with foil, but that can be even messier. When you’re ready to clean, combine ½ cup baking soda and enough hot water to cover the burned spots, and let rest for half an hour. Char should release easily with your abrasive tool of choice.

"Beef Negimaki","Japanese,Meat,Flank Steak,Scallion","Yield: 4 servings","
Salt
12
scallions, trimmed and halved crosswise

Ice
⅓
cup soy sauce
⅓
cup mirin
⅓
cup sake
⅓
cup turbinado sugar, or ¼ cup granulated sugar
1
pound flank steak (about a 6- to 7-inch square in size)

Vegetable oil, for greasing grates","307 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
In a large saucepan of salted boiling water, blanch lighter scallion ends for 1 minute, then add darker green scallion ends and blanch for 1 minute longer. Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water to cool, then drain and transfer scallions to a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess water.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake and sugar, stirring to dissolve most of the sugar.
Step 3
Working on a cutting board, cut flank steak against the grain into 4 equal strips, then cut each strip in half for 8 equal square pieces of meat. Keeping your knife parallel to the cutting board, butterfly each square by horizontally slicing against the grain through the middle. (Leave it attached on one side; do not cut all the way through.) Carefully open it like a book. Each of the 8 pieces should be about 3 inches wide.
Step 4
Using a meat mallet and working with one piece of meat at a time, cover each with plastic wrap and pound until 1/16-inch thick, creating rectangles that are about 5-by-6 inches. Transfer meat to the soy sauce marinade, turn to coat and let stand for 5 minutes.
Step 5
Heat grill to medium-high and grease the grates. (Alternatively, grease a grill pan or griddle to use on the stovetop.) Remove steak from marinade and transfer to a work surface. Transfer marinade to a small saucepan over medium-low and simmer until thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 6
Meanwhile, divide scallions among the 8 pieces of steak, arranging on one side along the shorter edge (scallions should be parallel to the grain). Tightly roll meat around the scallions and secure in two places with toothpicks where meat overlaps, threading the toothpicks parallel to the roll but not through the scallions in the center.
Step 7
Grill the negimaki, turning occasionally, until nicely charred and cooked through, reducing heat to medium halfway through, about 12 minutes. (If using a grill pan, heat on stovetop over medium-high and reduce heat to medium halfway through.)
Step 8
Once negimaki are cooked, lightly brush them with some of the reduced glaze, then transfer to a cutting board. Remove toothpicks, cut negimaki into bite-size pieces and arrange on a serving platter. Drizzle with the remaining glaze, and serve warm.

¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil

Salt and freshly ground black pepper","861 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 475 degrees. Put fish on a rimmed baking sheet and season with salt and pepper; set aside.
Step 2
Make the nori oil: Place crumbled seaweed snacks in a blender or mini food processor. With the motor running, drizzle in ¼ cup of the olive oil and continue to blend until the oil is black, 1 to 3 minutes, scraping down the sides if needed. (Because there’s such a small amount of liquid, you may need to stir a lot in between pulses. If you like, you can double the ingredients and save some for next time; it will keep for at least a few weeks in the fridge.) When the oil is well blended, stir in a pinch each of salt and pepper and set aside.
Step 3
Pour the remaining ¼ cup olive oil all over fish. Thinly slice 1½ lemons. (Save the other lemon half for serving.) Arrange lemon slices on top of the fish. Roast until the fish is opaque and just cooked through but not yet flaky, about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of fish. Remove from oven and brush two-thirds of the nori oil on top of fish; set aside to rest while preparing the butter.
Step 4
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the foam subsides, the milk solids turn golden-brown and it smells nutty and toasty, 3 to 5 minutes. Add parsley and capers, and cook for another minute. (Be careful when adding capers, as they may splatter once they hit the hot butter.) Pour the sizzling butter mixture over the fish and squeeze a little lemon juice from the reserved half on top. Serve immediately with remaining nori oil on the side for more drizzling.

"Zuni Café Chicken","Roast Chicken,Whole Chicken,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 2 or more servings","
One small chicken, 2¾ to 3½ pounds
4
sprigs fresh thyme, marjoram, rosemary or sage

Sea salt
¼
teaspoon ground black pepper","1296 user ratings","60 to 90 minutes, plus 1 to  2 days for dry brining","Step 1
Season the chicken 1 to 3 days before serving (for 3¼- to 3½-pound chickens, at least 2 days): Remove and discard the lump of fat inside the chicken. Pat the chicken very dry (a wet chicken will spend too much time steaming before it begins to turn golden brown).
Step 2
Slide a finger under the skin of each of the breasts, making 2 little pockets, then use a fingertip to gently loosen a pocket of skin on the outside of the thickest section of each thigh. Push an herb sprig into each of the 4 pockets.
Step 3
Using about ¾ teaspoon sea salt per pound of chicken and pepper to taste, season the chicken liberally all over with salt and the pepper. Sprinkle a little of the salt just inside the cavity and on the backbone. Twist and tuck the wing tips behind the shoulders. Cover loosely and refrigerate.
Step 4
When you’re ready to cook the chicken, heat the oven to 475 degrees. Depending on your oven and the size of your bird, you may need to adjust the heat to as high as 500 degrees or as low as 450 degrees during roasting to brown the chicken properly.
Step 5
Choose a shallow flameproof roasting pan or dish barely larger than the chicken, or use a 10-inch skillet with an all-metal handle. Preheat the pan over medium heat. Wipe the chicken dry and set it breast side up in the pan. It should sizzle.
Step 6
Place in the center of the oven and watch for it to start sizzling and browning within 20 minutes. If it doesn’t, raise the temperature progressively until it does. The skin should blister, but if the chicken begins to char, or the fat is smoking, reduce the temperature by 25 degrees. After about 30 minutes, turn the bird over (drying the bird and preheating the pan should keep the skin from sticking). Roast for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on size, then flip back over to re-crisp the breast skin, another 5 to 10 minutes. Total oven time will be 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Step 7
Remove the chicken from the roasting pan and set on a plate. Pour the clear fat from the pan, leaving the drippings. Add about a tablespoon of water to the hot pan and swirl. Slash the stretched skin between the thighs and breasts of the chicken, then tilt the bird and plate over the roasting pan to drain the juice into the drippings. As the chicken rests, tilt the roasting pan and skim the last of the fat. Place over medium-low heat, add any juice that has collected under the chicken, and bring to a simmer. Stir and scrape.
Step 8
Cut the chicken into pieces and pour the pan drippings over the chicken.

8
ounces ricotta
4
ounces feta, crumbled
1
garlic clove, grated

Chopped fresh parsley, chervil or chives, for garnish","3199 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Heat oven to 425 degrees. On a lightly floured surface, roll puff pastry into a 10-by-14-inch rectangle. Using a paring knife, lightly score a border around the perimeter of the puff pastry about a ¼ inch away from the edges. Place puff pastry on a parchment-lined baking sheet and prick the pastry inside the border using a fork to prevent puffing in the center. Bake on top rack until puff pastry is lightly golden, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly.
Step 2
Meanwhile, toss carrots with 1 tablespoon oil, season generously with salt and pepper and spread into a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast carrots on the bottom rack (underneath the puff pastry) until the edges are golden brown and carrots are still crisp-tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 3
While puff pastry and carrots are in the oven, blend ricotta, feta and garlic in a food processor until smooth. Season with salt and pepper.
Step 4
Spread the cheese mixture onto the puff pastry up to the border and arrange the carrots in a single layer on top. Bake until the carrots are tender and the edges of the cheese mixture are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 5
Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with herbs before serving.

1½ to 2
pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
2
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","1948 user ratings","About 35 minutes","Step 1
In a measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the yogurt, mayonnaise, chives, dill and garlic powder; season with 1½ teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. Transfer half the ranch to a medium bowl.
Step 2
Pat the chicken dry. If thickness varies greatly, pound to an even thickness of about ½ inch. Season both sides with salt and pepper, then transfer the chicken to the medium bowl with the ranch and toss to coat. Let sit at least 15 minutes, or refrigerate overnight. (Let it come to room temperature before cooking.)
Step 3
Heat the oil in a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if necessary, cook the chicken (with the marinade still on it) until deeply caramelized on the outside, the chicken releases from the pan and its juices run clear, 4 to 6 minutes per side. Turn down the heat if the chicken is browning too quickly.
Step 4
If the ranch in the measuring cup is too thick, add a little bit of water to loosen it. (You should be able to drizzle it easily.) Serve chicken with the ranch passed at the table and more herbs as desired.

Melt the butter in a wok or saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the oyster sauce, soy sauce and fish sauce, and stir to combine. Remove from the heat.
Step 2
Meanwhile, bring 1½ inches of water to a boil in a 12-​inch skillet or sauté pan over high heat. (Alternatively, heat up just enough water to cover the spaghetti in a large Dutch oven or saucepan.) Add the pasta, stir a few times to make sure it’s not clumping, and cook, stirring occasionally, until just shy of al dente (about 2 minutes short of the recommended cook time on the package).
Step 3
Using tongs, transfer the cooked pasta to the garlic sauce, along with whatever water clings to it. (Reserve the pasta water in the skillet.) Increase the heat to high, add the cheese to the wok, and stir with a wooden spatula or spoon and toss vigorously until the sauce is creamy and emulsified, about 30 seconds. If the sauce looks too watery, let it keep reducing. If it looks greasy, splash some more cooking water into it and let it re-​emulsify. Stir in the scallions (if using), and serve immediately.

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper

1
tablespoon dark brown sugar
1
tablespoon fish sauce
1
tablespoon lemon juice
3
tablespoons cold unsalted butter, kept whole

Cilantro leaves with tender stems, for serving","1933 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 450 degrees. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season lightly with salt and pepper. (The fish-sauce butter is plenty salty, so don’t overdo the salt here.) Arrange the chicken skin-side up on a sheet pan and drizzle the oil over the chicken skin, coating it evenly. Roast until the chicken is light gold and the sheet pan is pooling with hot, rendered chicken fat, about 25 minutes.
Step 2
Take the sheet pan out of the oven, scatter the bread around the chicken and toss gently to coat in the chicken fat. Place the pan back in the oven and roast until the chicken is golden, crispy and sizzling (you’ll hear it), about 15 minutes.
Step 3
While the chicken roasts, combine the brown sugar, fish sauce and lemon juice in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, occasionally swirling the pan or stirring the sauce with a wooden spoon, until bubbling vigorously and the mixture has reduced by about half, 2 to 3 minutes. This part is fun: Turn off the heat and add the butter, constantly swirling the pan or stirring with a wooden spoon, until all of the butter has melted and incorporated into the fish sauce mixture.
Step 4
To serve, scatter the cilantro all over the chicken and bread and spoon some of the fish-sauce butter over each chicken thigh, reserving some to add to each plate for dipping the chicken and croutons while eating (which is divine).
Many breads will work here, especially stale loaves that you’re trying to use up. Crusty sourdough lends pleasurable tang for instance, while chewy tender milk bread tastes comfortingly sweet.

Kosher salt

Olive oil
1
(½-inch) piece ginger, peeled
1
cup firmly packed mint leaves
1
small lime","665 user ratings","15 minutes, plus grill heating","Step 1
Prepare a charcoal or gas grill for two-zone cooking over high heat: For a charcoal grill, pour the coals onto one half of the grill. For a gas grill, heat all the burners, then turn off one of the end burners. (See Tips.)
Step 2
Meanwhile, pat the shrimp dry, then transfer to a medium bowl. Season with 1½ teaspoons salt and lightly coat with olive oil. Set aside. Coarsely chop the ginger, then add the mint and a pinch of salt. Finely chop the ginger and mint together until homogenous. Transfer to a small bowl, finely grate ½ teaspoon lime zest into the bowl, and mix to combine. Cut the lime into wedges for serving.
Step 3
When you're ready to grill, take the shrimp, mint-ginger mixture, lime wedges, a tightly folded paper towel soaked in olive oil, a serving platter and tongs to the grill. Clean the grates with a grill brush, then oil the grates with the paper towel. Add the shrimp perpendicular to the grates over the flame and cook until well browned, about 2 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until opaque throughout, 1 to 2 minutes. (See Tips.)
Step 4
Transfer the shrimp to the platter and toss with the mint-ginger mixture and a squeeze of lime.
High is above 450 degrees. You should be able to hold your hand 4 to 5 inches above the grates for 2 to 3 seconds.
If flare-ups occur, move the shrimp to an area of the grill where there are no flames underneath. For a gas grill, close the lid between flips, listening and keeping an eye out for flare-ups.

pound pasta, like pappardelle or rigatoni
¾
cup coarsely grated Parmigiano- Reggiano","3630 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Put a large pot of generously salted water over high heat, and bring to a boil. In a small skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and garlic, and cook until the garlic begins to sizzle. Reduce heat to low, and cook very gently until garlic is soft and begins to turn light gold, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
Step 2
When water is boiling, add kale leaves, and cook until tender, but not mushy, about 5 minutes. Pull out the hot, dripping kale leaves with tongs, and put directly into a blender. (Don’t drain the pot; you’ll use that same boiling water to cook the pasta.) Add garlic and its oil to the blender, along with a splash of hot water from the pot if you need some more liquid to get the blender going. Blend into a fine, thick green purée. Taste, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, then blend again.
Step 3
Add the pasta to the still-boiling water, and cook according to directions on the package. Ladle out about a cup of the water to save for finishing the dish, then drain the pasta and return it to the dry pot. Add the kale purée, about ¾ of the grated cheese and a splash of the reserved pasta water. Toss until all the pasta is well coated and bright green, adding another splash of pasta water if needed so that the sauce is loose and almost creamy in texture. Serve in bowls right away, and top with an extra drizzle of olive oil and the rest of the grated cheese.

1
tablespoon unsalted butter or vegan butter
1
tablespoon tamari
½
cup barbecue sauce","831 user ratings","30 minutes, plus drying","Step 1
Two and a half hours before serving, start drying out the tofu: Place the slices in a single layer between clean, dry dish towels or double layers of paper towels. Press to remove water from the tofu, and let stand for 2 hours, replacing the soaked towels once or twice, until there is very little water left in the tofu. (You can press and dry the tofu quickly, and use it immediately, but it will be less crisp.)
Step 2
Heat a broiler to its highest setting. Heat a large skillet over medium and add the oil and butter, swirling to cover the bottom. Pour the tamari into a small, shallow dish. Press the tofu one last time. Quickly dip both sides of a single slice in the tamari and place it in the skillet. (Be careful as the liquid may lead to hot pops from the oil.) Repeat with the remaining tofu slices and tamari.
Step 3
Cook until the tofu gets the same beautiful golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. While the tofu browns, spread half of the barbecue sauce on a small rimmed baking sheet. Transfer the tofu to the barbecue sauce on the sheet, then cover with the remaining sauce. Broil, turning once, until the sauce thickens and bubbles, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve hot.

Cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then slice crosswise into 6 sections. (You’ll have 12 squares total.) Transfer to a towel-lined plate and pat dry, then sprinkle with salt.
Step 2
Transfer the coconut milk to a liquid measuring cup or medium bowl, add the green curry paste, stir with a fork until smooth, then season to taste with salt. (Be aware that some curry pastes are quite salty.)
Step 3
Arrange the tofu in an even layer in a large (12-inch) nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Pour 2 tablespoons coconut-curry mixture over the tofu and flip the tofu to coat. Set the skillet over medium-high and cook tofu without flipping until the skillet is dry and the undersides of the tofu are speckled golden, 3 to 5 minutes.
Step 4
Add the oil, swirl to coat, then flip the tofu. Cook until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes, then flip once more until the remaining side is browned and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes, adding more oil as needed. Transfer to a plate.
Step 5
If the skillet is dry, add more oil, over medium-high, then add the vegetables, season with salt and cook, without stirring, until charred underneath, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour in the remaining coconut-curry mixture and boil, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are crisp-tender and the liquid has thickened to a glaze, 4 to 5 minutes. (The sauce is ready when a spoon dragged across the bottom of the skillet leaves a trail.) Turn off the heat, stir in the lime juice, then add the tofu and gently stir to coat. Season to taste with salt. Eat on top of rice.
This recipe accommodates any vegetable that will cook in 6 to 8 minutes. If you’d like to use a vegetable that takes longer, like sliced carrots or winter squash, sear them for a few additional minutes, tossing occasionally, before pouring in the coconut-curry mixture.

Step 4
When you are ready to bake, heat the oven to 350 degrees, uncover the dish, and gently flip each piece of bread, one at a time, so the side that is more saturated with custard is on the top. Rearrange the slices decoratively, as needed, so the rounded edges of the slices are exposed. Dot the top with the 3 tablespoons butter and cover with foil.

cup dark or semisweet chocolate pieces or chips, peanut butter cups or chips","23 user ratings","15 minutes, plus 1½ hours cooling","Step 1
Heat the oven to 275 degrees. Scatter the nuts and seeds on a large sheet pan in an even layer. Bake until they are lightly toasted and maybe browned in spots, about 12 minutes, turning the nuts and seeds over as best you can and rotating the sheet pan halfway through cooking.
Step 2
Remove from the oven, add the cherries and ¼ teaspoon salt and stir with a wooden spoon. Spread the mixture out again to let cool until you can easily handle the sheet pan with bare hands, 15 to 20 minutes. (If you add the chocolate to the sheet pan directly at this stage, it might melt a little. But if you prefer the chocolate to melt into your clusters, add half the chocolate directly to the sheet pan along with the dried fruit. After cooling, add remaining chocolate then transfer to a bowl, using a flat spatula to scrape any chocolate from the pan, and let cool until solid again, 30 to 90 minutes.)
Step 3
Transfer to a bowl, then stir in the chocolate (if you haven’t already added it). Enjoy immediately, or store for up to one month in an airtight container at a cool temperature.

6
garlic cloves, very thinly sliced

A handful of pickled chiles (such as pepperoncini or banana peppers)

A bunch of thinly sliced scallions

Roasted gold or black sesame seeds (or a mix)","163 user ratings","50 minutes, plus overnight resting","Step 1
Prepare the marinade: In a large saucepan, heat the oil over medium until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomato paste, gochujang, gochugaru and black pepper. Stir until homogenous and a light film starts to form on the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute. Add rice or corn syrup, soy sauce and sesame oil. Bring to a simmer and remove and discard ginger slices. Using a ladle, transfer half of the mixture to a large bowl and set aside.
Step 2
Prepare the pizza sauce: Add stock and crushed tomatoes to the remaining mixture in the saucepan, stir to combine and simmer until reduced to about 1¼ cup, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a container, allow to cool and refrigerate until ready to use.
Step 3
Add the chicken to the marinade in the bowl and toss to thoroughly coat. Transfer to a sealed container and let marinate for at least 1 night and up to 3.
Step 4
Meanwhile, make the pizza dough: In a heavy-duty food processor (see Tip) fitted with a dough blade or regular blade, combine flour, sugar, salt and yeast. Pulse a few times to mix thoroughly. Add the oil and 270 grams/9.5 ounces lukewarm water (about 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons). Run the food processor until a cohesive ball of dough forms and starts to ride around the blade. Let the processor continue running for 30 seconds, then shut it off.
Step 5
Transfer the dough ball to a bowl at least double its volume. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then transfer to the refrigerator for at least 1 night and up to 3.
Step 6
On the day you’re ready to bake, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and, using a bench scraper or knife, divide the dough in half. Using floured hands, form each half into a tight ball, gathering the dough to a point on the bottom and pinching it shut to form a sort of stretched “skin” around the ball. Transfer each ball to a lightly oiled bowl at least thrice its volume. Cover the bowls (you can use a cutting board or pot lids, plastic wrap or aluminum foil) and let them rest at room temperature until doubled in volume and quite slack, at least 2 hours and up to 6.
Step 7
When ready to bake, adjust an oven rack to a few inches below the broiler, place a baking stone or steel on it, and heat the oven to the highest temperature it can muster (500 to 550 degrees, preferably) for at least 45 minutes. If you have convection, use it.
Step 8
Spread the marinated chicken on a rimmed, foil-lined baking sheet. Place the baking sheet directly on the pizza stone and cook the chicken until cooked through and charred in spots, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and, when cool enough to handle, roughly chop it into pizza topping-sized pieces.
Step 9
Turn a single dough ball out into a bowl of flour and turn to coat. Transfer to a well-floured wooden pizza peel or the bottom of an overturned baking sheet. Using your fingertips, dimple the center of the dough repeatedly, pushing the dough out into a circle about 8 to 10 inches in diameter, leaving the outer rim higher than the rest. Using flat hands and dusting underneath or on top with flour as needed, stretch the dough out into a 12- to 14-inch circle.
Step 10
Working as quickly as you are able, using the back of the spoon, evenly spread half of the sauce on top of the dough, leaving a rim around the edge. Spread half of the chopped chicken on top, followed by half of the mozzarella. Add half the garlic slices and half the pickled chiles. With clean, dry hands, pull the edges of the pizza out to stretch it a bit. Shake the pizza peel to ensure the pizza moves loosely.
Step 11
Slide the pizza onto the baking stone and bake until the crust and cheese are as cooked as you like them, typically 5 to 8 minutes, though this timing can vary a lot depending on your oven and your taste. Keep an eye on the pizza and turn it a few times as it cooks if necessary.
Step 12
Using a thin metal pizza peel or large spatula, retrieve the pizza and slide it onto a cutting board. Top with scallions and sesame seeds. Cut into slices and serve immediately.
Step 13
Repeat Steps 9 through 12 with the remaining ingredients.
In a well-stocked Korean or Asian market, you’ll find gochugaru (Korean chile flakes) and gochujang (a fermented chile and wheat paste) in varying levels of spiciness. In this recipe, you can vary the heat level by using the hot or mild versions, varying the amounts or adding ground cayenne or hot sauce. Once the sauce base is made, adjust the heat level according to taste before dividing it at the end of Step 1.
Alternatively, make the dough by hand or in a stand mixer: Combine all the dry ingredients, add the wet ingredients and mix until the dough just comes together. Let rest for 15 minutes, then knead 10 minutes at medium-low with a dough hook, or 15 to 20 minutes by hand. Proceed to Step 5.

4
ounces grated Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese (about 1 cup)
2
tablespoons unsalted butter
½
cup roasted, chopped New Mexico green chiles (see Tip)","416 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 300 degrees. In a medium bowl or measuring cup, whisk the eggs with ¾ teaspoon salt; season lightly with pepper. Arrange the tortillas on a sheet pan; it’s OK if they’re overlapping or hanging off the pan. Set both aside while you cook the potatoes.
Step 2
In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add half the hash browns and half the onion. Spread into a thin layer on the bottom and up the sides of the skillet. Use a spatula or fork to create a few holes in the hash browns to help steam escape for more browning. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip in large sections, add another tablespoon of oil, spread into a thin layer, and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 5 minutes. If there are areas of the potatoes that are pale on top, flip them so they brown. (Taking your time here ensures the potatoes stay crisp.) Add more oil if the pan looks dry at any point. Divide the potato mixture between 2 tortillas in a line down the center, leaving a 1-inch border.
Step 3
Repeat step 2 with the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, plus the potatoes and onions, then divide them between the 2 remaining tortillas. Sprinkle the cheese over the potatoes and tortillas, then transfer to the oven to warm while you cook the eggs.
Step 4
In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium-low and swirl to coat. Pour in the eggs and cook without touching until the eggs around the edges of the pan are set, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, fold and scrape across the pan to form big, fluffy curds, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Step 5
Transfer the tortillas to plates or, for portable and/or make-ahead burritos, transfer to individual squares of parchment paper. Spoon the eggs in a line next to the potatoes, then add the chiles (about 2 tablespoons per tortilla). Working with one tortilla at a time, fold the tortilla’s short sides over the filling, then fold the bottom of the tortilla snugly up and over the filling. Tightly roll away from you until the entire burrito is secure. If using parchment, wrap tightly in parchment. Repeat with the remaining burritos and enjoy. The potatoes may start to get soggy, but the burritos will stay warm for about 20 minutes. (Alternatively, you can refrigerate the burritos for up to 24 hours and reheat in the microwave or oven.)
If you can’t find fresh or jarred New Mexico chiles (the most common is Hatch), char Anaheim chiles, scrape away the skins and seeds, and chop, or use canned and drained diced green chiles.

Prepare the sauce: Tear 5 basil leaves in half; reserve the rest. Combine the torn basil, olive oil, garlic and red-pepper flakes (if using), in a small saucepan over very low heat for 10 minutes, allowing the basil and garlic to steep in the oil. (Do not let the garlic get beyond medium brown in color.) Remove from the heat, strain the oil, discard the solids and set aside.
Step 2
In a large pot, combine the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, salt and pepper with 2 cups water and the infused oil. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately reduce to a simmer. Remove ½ cup of the sauce for the meatballs, setting aside to cool.
Step 3
Partially cover the pot and simmer the sauce, undisturbed, while you prepare the meatballs.
Step 4
In a large bowl, hand mix all the meatball ingredients (including the reserved ½ cup sauce) until combined. (The mixture will be quite soft.) Wet your hands and pinch off approximately ¼-cup portions and roll them into balls between your palms. (They should each be about 2 ¼-inches wide.) Place each meatball on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining mixture, making about 16 meatballs.
Step 5
Once all the meatballs have been rolled, carefully drop them into the simmering sauce. If the pot seems too full, shimmy the pot back and forth gently to make more room to simmer the meatballs in an even layer. Do not stir, as the meatballs will break apart.
Step 6
Cover the pot partially with a lid and gently simmer the meatballs in the sauce for 1 hour (or up to 2 hours) until they are firm and cooked through. Carefully remove the meatballs to a plate, adding spoonfuls of sauce, or transfer the meatballs and sauce to a shallow serving bowl. Chop the remaining basil and sprinkle on top, and garnish with more grated Pecorino.

¾
teaspoon ground coriander
¼
teaspoon fine salt","427 user ratings","1 ½ hours, plus at least 3 hours’ chilling and 25 hours’ resting ","Step 1
Prepare the filling: In a medium pan over medium heat, bring the milk to a simmer, then whisk in the Cream of Wheat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 2 ½ minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Let cool slightly, then stir in the butter, sugar and salt. Let cool, then refrigerate for at least 3 hours and up to overnight. Once you’re ready to assemble the cake, bring the filling back to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Beat in a stand mixer with a paddle attachment or with a spoon until fluffy.
Step 2
While filling chills, make the torte: Warm the sugar, milk, honey and butter in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring well until sugar is dissolved, butter is melted and ingredients are thoroughly combined. Remove from heat and let cool for a few minutes until lukewarm, then pour into a stand mixer. Add the eggs and mix with the paddle attachment on medium just until incorporated.
Step 3
Sift together the 4 ¼ cups flour with the baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cardamom, coriander and salt, then add to the bowl of the mixer. Mix on medium-low until a smooth, not sticky, dough is formed, adding more flour if needed, a few teaspoons at a time. Using a dough cutter, divide the dough into 4 equal balls. Set on a plate and cover with a towel; let rest at room temperature for 1 hour to allow the gluten to relax.
Step 4
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Lightly dust each ball of dough all over with flour before placing it in the middle of a sheet of parchment paper. Using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll the dough into approximately a 10-inch circle, about ⅛- to ¼-inch thick. Cut out a circle using a sharp knife and a 9-inch-round dinner plate or baking pan. Save the scraps of dough, pushing them to the sides of the parchment paper, away from the circle. Transfer the paper with the circle and the scraps to a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining dough balls. You can use 4 separate baking sheets (or use 2 baking sheets at a time and then repeat).
Step 5
Bake 2 sheets at a time until the top of each round is slightly puffed and set, about 7 to 10 minutes. (Watch carefully, as they can burn quickly.) Let cool, then pulverize the scraps in a food processor or blender. Reserve the crumbs in an airtight container to decorate the cake.
Step 6
Assemble the cake: Tear a sheet of parchment into several wide strips and use the strips to line the bottom of a serving plate in a circular pattern. (These will be removed before serving and will help keep the plate clean while you decorate the cake.) Place the first baked cake layer on top of the parchment and spread with 1 ½ cups of filling. Top with a second cake layer and then spread the apricot or sour cherry preserves on top, leaving ½-inch border uncovered along the perimeter. Top with a third cake layer and spread with 1 ½ cups filling. Add the final cake layer, then spread 1 ½ cups filling on top and the remaining 1 ½ cups filling on the sides. Pat the reserved crumbs over the top and sides, just enough to lightly cover, reserving the rest.
Step 7
Let cake stand at room temperature, covered with aluminum foil or plastic wrap, for at least 24 hours — or, ideally, 2 days. (Refrigerating the cake would cause the frosting to firm up, preventing the cake layers from soaking it up and softening as they are intended to do.)
Step 8
To enjoy, sprinkle more of the reserved crumbs all over the cake to add texture. Carefully slide out and discard the parchment paper strips before cutting into slices to serve.

"Crispy Chickpea Stew With Greens and Lemon","One Pot,Soups And Stews,Chickpea,Feta,Goat Cheese,Sturdy Green,Dinner,Easy,Weeknight,Main Course","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","3
(15-ounce) cans chickpeas, drained and rinsed
1
large lemon
4
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
1¼
teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more as needed

Freshly ground black pepper
6
garlic cloves, 2 thinly sliced, 4 minced
1
large onion, diced
1
tablespoon fresh oregano, finely chopped

Pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
12
ounces hardy winter greens, such as collards, kale or mustard greens, stems removed and roughly chopped
1
quart vegetable or chicken stock
1
cup crumbled feta or goat cheese (8 ounces)
¼
cup parsley leaves, for serving","640 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Place 2 cups drained chickpeas on a clean kitchen towel or a double layer of paper towels, and pat them dry. Grate the zest from the lemon into a small bowl and cut the naked lemon in half. Set aside.
Step 2
In a large soup pot, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chickpeas and ½ teaspoon salt and some black pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisped, 8 to 10 minutes. Add another tablespoon oil and the sliced garlic to the pot (save the minced garlic for later). Cook until the garlic is golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the chickpeas and garlic to a paper towel-lined plate.
Step 3
While the crispy chickpeas are still hot, sprinkle them with half of the lemon zest and with salt and pepper to taste. Wipe out the pot.
Step 4
Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook until soft and golden brown, 5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic, oregano, remaining ¾ teaspoon salt and the red-pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the remaining drained chickpeas, greens and stock and bring to a simmer. Cook, covered, over medium-low heat until the greens are very tender, 25 to 30 minutes.
Step 5
Stir in the feta, remaining lemon zest and the juice from half a lemon. Taste and add more salt and lemon juice, if needed. To serve, ladle the stew into individual bowls and top with some of the crispy chickpeas and garlic. Drizzle with oil, sprinkle with parsley and red-pepper flakes if you’d like, and another squeeze of lemon.
You can skip the feta, if you like. It adds saltiness and tang, but you’d never miss it if it wasn’t there.
Juicy halved cherry tomatoes are a great addition here; add a cup or two of them along with the feta.

"Challah Bread","Jewish,Breads,Project,Active Dry Yeast,Bread Flour,Egg,Egg Yolk,Golden Raisin,Honey,Side Dish,Dairy Free,Rosh Hashana","Yield: 1 large loaf","For the Preferment
1
teaspoon active dry yeast
1¼
cups/169 grams bread flour
For the Dough
½
cup/72 grams golden raisins (optional)
⅓
cup/113 grams honey
⅓
cup/75 grams extra-virgin olive oil
1
large egg yolk, at room temperature
2
large eggs, at room temperature, plus 1 beaten egg, for egg wash
3
cups/405 grams bread flour, plus more for kneading the dough
11
grams kosher salt (about 1 tablespoon Diamond Crystal or 1½ teaspoons Morton coarse kosher salt)

Poppy or sesame seeds, for sprinkling (optional)","923 user ratings","1 hour 20 minutes, plus proofing and cooling","Step 1
Make the preferment: In a medium bowl, combine the yeast and ¼ cup/57 grams warm tap water (100 to 110 degrees), and whisk until the yeast is dissolved. Add another ½ cup/113 grams room temperature water and the bread flour, and stir with a flexible spatula or bowl scraper until you have a smooth, pasty mixture with no dry spots. It should look like a thick batter.
Step 2
Scrape the mixture into the center of the bowl and cover tightly. Let the preferment sit at room temperature until it’s nearly tripled in size, extremely bubbly across the surface, and jiggles on the verge of collapsing when the bowl is shaken, 1 to 2 hours (depending on the ambient temperature).
Step 3
If making a raisin-studded challah, while the preferment is getting bubbly, place the raisins in a medium bowl and cover with boiling water. Cover the bowl and let the raisins soak until they’re plumped and softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the raisins, pat them dry, and set aside.
Step 4
Mix the dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together the honey, olive oil, the yolk and 2 of the eggs until smooth, then add to the bowl with the preferment. Add the bread flour and salt. Use a flexible spatula or bowl scraper to stir the mixture, making sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate the preferment, until a shaggy dough comes together.
Step 5
Knead the dough: Generously flour the work surface, then scrape the dough and any floury bits out of the bowl and onto the surface (reserve the bowl). Generously flour the dough. Use the heel of your hands to knead the dough, adding flour as needed if the dough is sticking to your hands or the surface, until the dough is very smooth, elastic and slightly tacky, 10 to 15 minutes. (You can also combine everything in a stand mixer and mix on low speed with the dough hook for 8 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.)
Step 6
Test the dough: Pinch off a golf ball-size piece and flatten it with your fingertips. Stretch the dough outward in all directions gently and slowly: You should be able to form a sheet of dough that’s thin enough to allow light to pass through without tearing. If the dough tears, continue kneading. For a raisin-studded challah, use your hands to flatten the dough into a 1-inch-thick slab (the shape doesn’t matter) and scatter the drained raisins over the dough. Roll up the dough and gather it back into a ball, then knead until the raisins are distributed throughout.
Step 7
Let the dough rise: Gather the dough into a smooth ball, dust lightly with flour and place back in the reserved bowl. Cover and let the dough sit in a warm spot until it’s doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours (depending on the ambient temperature).
Step 8
Divide the dough: Punch down the dough inside the bowl to expel the gasses that built up during the first rise, then scrape the dough out onto a clean work surface. For a braided loaf, use a bench scraper or knife to divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. (You can eyeball it, or weigh the pieces for accuracy — each piece should weigh 180 to 190 grams.) For a round loaf, divide the dough in half.
Step 9
Braid or twist the dough: For a braid, roll each of the 6 pieces into snakes measuring about 18 inches long and slightly tapered at the ends. Dust the strands in flour to coat them lightly, then line them up so they’re side by side. Pinch together the ends of the strands to connect them at the top.
Step 10
Take the strand on the far right and cross it over the other strands, so it’s all the way on the far left side, placing it perpendicular to the other strands. Then, take the strand that was originally on the far left, and is now second from the left, and bring it all the way to the far right, also placing it perpendicularly.
Step 11
Fan out the remaining strands so there’s a generous space in the center. Take the strand on the far left and bring it to the center, but group it with the strands on the right. Next, bring the strand that’s second from the right and cross it over to the far left, also placing it perpendicular. Then, fan out the strands again, leaving a space in the center, and bring the strand on the far right to the center, grouping it with the strands on the left. Bring the strand second from the left to the far right and cross it over to the far left. Then, repeat this process until you’ve braided the entire length of the strands, tugging gently on the strands as you work to create tension in the braid. Pinch the ends of the braids and tuck them underneath the loaf, then transfer to a parchment-lined sheet pan. Make sure you have a couple of inches of clearance on either side of the braid so it can expand.
Step 12
Alternatively, for a round, roll the two pieces of dough into long snakes measuring about 28 inches long, making sure to taper the snakes at one end. Dust the strands in flour to coat them lightly, then line them up so they’re side by side with the tapered ends aligned. Twist the two strands together, then start at the tapered end and roll up the twist into a tight coil, wrapping the fatter end around and tucking the end underneath the coil. Transfer the coil to a parchment-lined sheet pan.
Step 13
Egg wash and proof the dough: Beat the remaining egg in a small bowl until it’s streak-free. Brush the loaf with the egg, then loosely cover the dough with some lightly oiled plastic wrap on a sheet pan, and let it rise at room temperature until it’s doubled in size, extremely puffy, and springs back but holds a slight indentation when poked gently with a wet finger, another 1½ to 2 hours (but possibly longer, depending on ambient temperature). The dough is easy to underproof, so, if you’re unsure, err on the side of overproofing. (The round loaf will also take longer to proof.) Alternatively, before proofing, you can refrigerate the dough overnight, but omit the egg wash and make sure it’s covered (plastic should cover it loosely but be sealed around the pan so the dough doesn't dry out).
Step 14
Heat the oven: Arrange a rack in the center of the oven and heat it to 350 degrees.
Step 15
Bake: Uncover the challah and brush with another layer of egg wash. Sprinkle the loaf with poppy or sesame seeds (if using) and bake until the loaf is shiny and burnished, an instant-read thermometer registers 190 degrees when inserted into the center, and it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the challah cool completely on the baking sheet.
The challah, stored in a paper bag at room temperature, will keep for 4 days. It benefits from toasting after the first day.

Salt and freshly ground black pepper
8
breakfast sausage links, either cooked or uncooked is fine, pricked all over with a fork
4
large eggs

Buttered toast, for serving","469 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 450 degrees. In a medium bowl, toss together the mushrooms, tomatoes, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, thyme sprigs and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Place sausage links onto a rimmed sheet pan and spread vegetables evenly around the sausages. Bake until browned and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes, tossing halfway through.
Step 2
Take the pan out of the oven and use a spatula to push the vegetables and sausages to one side. Drizzle the empty side of the pan with a little olive oil, then crack in the eggs; season lightly with salt and pepper. Immediately return the pan to the oven and roast until the whites are just set, the yolks are still runny, 3 to 5 minutes longer. If you prefer medium or hard egg yolks, cook a minute more.
Step 3
Using a spatula, cut the eggs apart. Slide them off the pan and onto plates right away to stop the yolks from solidifying. Discard thyme sprigs and serve vegetables with the eggs, drizzling with a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and more salt and pepper, if you’d like. Serve with buttered toast.
Plant-based sausages work well here, and you can replace the Worcestershire with vegan Worcestershire, tamari or coconut amino acids.

1
large garlic clove, finely grated or minced
1½
tablespoons fresh lime juice, plus more to taste
½
teaspoon ground cumin, plus more to taste

Salt and black pepper
5
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil","170 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 425 degrees. Using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a chef’s knife and a cutting board, lightly crack the coriander, cumin, and fennel or caraway seeds.
Step 2
Place brussels sprouts and scallion whites (save the greens for garnish) on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil to coat and sprinkle with the cracked spices and salt. Stir to combine everything, then spread into an even layer in the pan. Roast for 15 minutes, until golden brown.
Step 3
While sprouts are in the oven, make the lime vinaigrette. In a small bowl, combine garlic, lime juice, cumin and a big pinch each salt and pepper. Slowly whisk in olive oil. Taste and adjust salt, cumin and lime; it should be tangy.
Step 4
Raise oven temperature to 475 degrees and sprinkle paneer over the brussels sprouts. Lightly drizzle with more olive oil (another 1 to 2 tablespoons) and sprinkle with another pinch of salt, paprika and cayenne, if you like. Roast until cheese gets slightly brown and sprouts are browned and tender, 9 to 12 minutes.
Step 5
Remove from oven and drizzle lime vinaigrette on paneer and sprouts when still hot right out of the oven (it will absorb it immediately). Sprinkle cilantro and scallion greens on top. Drizzle with a little more olive oil if you like, and serve with lime wedges for squeezing.
Substitute a 12- to 14-ounce package firm or extra-firm tofu, patted dry and sliced into ½-inch thick slabs, for the paneer. Add slabs to the pan along with the brussels sprouts in Step 2. The tofu won’t brown but it will soak up all the good flavors.
This recipe will work with a bevy of different veggies. Try substituting broccoli or cauliflower florets, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms, small cubes of butternut squash, turnips or sweet potato, sliced fennel or 1-inch-thick wedges of cabbage. Different vegetables might need more or less time in the oven. The key is to let them cook until they are about 10 minutes shy of being done, then adding the paneer. Ricotta salata and feta both make good paneer substitutes, though you’ll probably want to hold back on the salt since they’re both a lot saltier.

Arrange a rack on the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Cut the tofu in half lengthwise, then cut each half crosswise into 8 pieces, for a total of 16 domino-size pieces. Pat them dry and set aside.
Step 2
On a parchment-lined sheet pan, toss the onions with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with salt and pepper. (It’s OK — good even — if the wedges come apart; this will result in crisp edges.)
Step 3
In a medium bowl, stir together the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil with the sesame seeds, turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Pat the tofu dry once more, then add to the turmeric mixture and toss gently to coat. (Tofu can be refrigerated in the marinade up to 1 day ahead.)

recipe Challah Bread dough, prepared as directed below
4
tablespoons/56 grams olive oil, plus more for the pans
1
cup/220 grams light brown sugar
1
cup/96 grams almond flour
1
tablespoon ground cinnamon
½
teaspoon finely grated orange zest
½
teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or ¼ teaspoon Morton coarse kosher salt

All-purpose flour, for rolling
1
large egg","370 user ratings","1 hour 30 minutes, plus proofing and cooling","Step 1
Prepare the dough: Prepare the Challah Bread through Step 5. Let it sit in a warm spot until it’s doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.
Step 2
Meanwhile, prepare the pans and make the cinnamon mixture: Brush the bottoms and sides of 2 loaf pans with a thin layer of olive oil, then line the bottom and 2 longer sides with pieces of parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides. Brush the parchment with more oil, then set the pans aside. In a medium bowl, toss together the brown sugar, almond flour, cinnamon, orange zest and a generous pinch of salt until evenly combined, breaking up any lumps of brown sugar with your fingertips. Measure out ¼ cup of the mixture and set aside for sprinkling over the tops of the babkas, then set the remaining mixture aside.
Step 3
Roll out and fill the dough: Scrape the dough out of the bowl and onto a lightly floured surface. Flatten it with the heel of your hand to expel the gas, then cut the dough in half (each piece will weigh about 570 grams). Place one half on a small rimmed baking sheet, cover and refrigerate while you roll out the other. Press and tug the piece of dough on the work surface into a flat, narrow rectangular shape. Then, roll the dough into a long, thin rectangle measuring about 24 inches long and 8 inches wide, dusting the top and underneath with just a bit of flour as needed to keep the dough gliding across the surface (don’t use too much flour, as you want some friction between the surface and the dough). Brush off any excess flour, then drizzle the dough with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and brush the oil in an even layer all the way to the edges, leaving a clean ½-inch border on one of the longer sides. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon mixture, about 1 cup, (not including the ¼ cup you set aside for the top) evenly across the surface and pat it gently into the dough.
Step 4
Form and chill the babkas: Starting at the longer side opposite the clean border, roll the dough into a tight, spiraled log. Pinch the dough together at the seam so it closes, then squeeze the log to lengthen and thin it out until it measures about 28 inches long. Use a knife to trim off just the irregular ends, then cut the log in half crosswise. Place one half over the other, crossing them in the middle, then twist the halves together. Transfer the twist to one of the prepared pans and flatten it gently so it fills out the bottom of the pan. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and transfer it to the refrigerator, then remove the second piece of dough from the refrigerator and repeat the rolling and forming process, using the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the remaining cinnamon mixture. Cover the second pan and refrigerate. Chill the babkas for at least 4 and up to 12 hours.
Step 5
Proof the babkas: Remove the babkas from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature until they’re nearly triple their original size and they come up to about ¾ of the pan, 3 to 4 hours.
Step 6
Heat the oven: Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
Step 7
Brush with egg and bake: Beat the egg in a small bowl until it’s streak-free. Uncover the pans and brush the egg across the surfaces of the dough. Sprinkle the babkas with the reserved ¼ cup of cinnamon mixture, dividing evenly. Bake the babkas side by side (but not touching) until they’re deep golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then run a paring knife down along the shorter sides of the pans to loosen them. Use the parchment paper to lift the babkas out of the pans and place on a wire rack. Let them cool completely.
The babka, stored covered at room temperature, will keep for up to 4 days in plastic wrap but is best served on the first or second day.

½
teaspoon red-pepper flakes, plus more as needed
1
teaspoon finely grated lemon zest plus 2 tablespoons juice (from 1 lemon), plus more juice as needed

Grated Parmesan, for serving","1295 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, in a large Dutch oven or skillet, heat half the oil over medium-high. Add half the squash in a single layer, season with salt and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Scoot the squash to the side of the pot, piling it up as needed to make room, then add the remaining oil. Arrange the remaining squash in a single layer, season with salt and cook until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. (If there’s not enough room for the second batch, remove the browned squash to a plate while you cook the rest.)
Step 2
When the water comes to a boil, add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. During the last 3 minutes of the cooking, add the kale. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.
Step 3
When all the squash is browned, return all the squash to the pot, if you set any aside while cooking the second batch. Reduce the heat to medium-low, add the butter and stir with the squash until the butter is golden, nutty smelling and foaming, 1 to 4 minutes. (If you’re using a dark pot, it can be hard to tell if the butter’s browned, so spoon some of the butter on the squash to see if the butter’s speckled brown.) Turn off the heat, add the garam masala and red-pepper flakes, and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 1 tablespoon of cold water (or an ice cube) and toss gently to stop the cooking, then set aside until the pasta is ready.
Step 4
Add the pasta and ½ cup pasta water to the squash mixture. Set over low heat and toss gently until the pasta is glossed with sauce. (Some squash pieces might break apart, which can be a good thing: better disbursement through the pasta.) If the pasta looks dry, add more pasta water as needed. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon zest and juice. Season to taste with more lemon juice, red-pepper flakes and salt. Top servings with grated Parmesan.

cups whole milk

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper (or white pepper)

Pinch of freshly grated nutmeg (optional)","207 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium-low. Add flour, whisk until smooth and cook until flour is no longer raw, about 1 minute. (Be sure to whisk all around the edges of the pan to prevent scorching.)
Step 2
Whisking constantly, slowly add ¼ cup of the milk in a thin stream and whisk until liquid is absorbed. (This happens very quickly. The mixture will seize up, but it will loosen as more milk is added.) Slowly add another ¼ cup of the milk in a thin stream and whisk until mixture is smooth. Repeat with remaining ¼ cup portions of the milk, whisking constantly until mixture is smooth before adding the next batch of milk.
Step 3
Once all of the milk is incorporated, continue to cook over medium-low, stirring frequently, until it starts to simmer and the sauce thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat and season with salt, pepper and nutmeg (if using).
Step 4

"Spicy Coconut Greens With Tomatoes and Shrimp","Vegetables,Cherry Tomato,Coconut Milk,Make Ahead,Shrimp,Swiss Chard,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","For the Coconut Greens
2
tablespoons virgin coconut oil
1
small yellow onion, finely chopped
2
pounds Swiss chard, leaves roughly shredded (about 7 cups), half the stems reserved then cut into ½-inch pieces
8
garlic cloves, finely grated
1
(2½-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated (about 1 ½ teaspoons)
¾
teaspoon red-pepper flakes (omit if you prefer less heat)
1
(13-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk, 2 tablespoons coconut milk reserved

Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1
tablespoon lime juice plus 1 lime, cut into 4 wedges for serving
1½
teaspoons fish sauce
For the Tomato and Shrimp Topping
3
tablespoons virgin coconut oil
½
teaspoon hot smoked paprika
½
teaspoon ground turmeric
3
red bird’s-eye chiles, pierced a few times with a knife
10
ounces datterini or cherry tomatoes
½
pound medium shrimp, peeled, deveined and tails removed","232 user ratings","1 ¼ hours","Step 1
Start with the greens: Heat the coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium-high. Once hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened but not colored, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chard stems, garlic, ginger and red-pepper flakes, and cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes, or until fragrant. Add the shredded chard leaves, one large handful at a time, stirring each batch to wilt before adding the next. (They won’t seem to fit at first glance, but don’t worry; they’ll cook down.)
Step 2
Pour in the coconut milk along with ½ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper, and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat down to medium and cook, stirring often so the bottom doesn’t scorch, for 50 to 55 minutes, or until the mixture is thick and the coconut milk almost completely reduces. Off the heat, stir in the lime juice and fish sauce, and set aside.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the topping: To a medium skillet, add 2 tablespoons of the coconut oil and melt over medium heat. Add the paprika, ¼ teaspoon of the turmeric, the chiles, tomatoes, 3 tablespoons water and ¼ teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 15 to 18 minutes, or until the tomatoes have burst and softened but still retain their shape. Keep warm on low heat.
Step 4
Meanwhile, toss the shrimp in a bowl with the remaining ¼ teaspoon turmeric, plus ¼ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon coconut oil to a large skillet and heat over high. Once it’s very hot, add half the shrimp and cook for about 1½ minutes on each side, or until nicely colored and just cooked through. As they’re ready, stir them into the tomato mixture. Continue in the same way with the remaining shrimp.
Step 5
When ready to serve, transfer the coconut greens to a large shallow serving bowl and spoon the tomato and shrimp mixture on top. Drizzle with the reserved coconut milk, and serve with the lime wedges to squeeze alongside.

In a large bowl, stir together the shallot, lemon juice and a pinch of salt; set aside.
Step 2
In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat 1½ tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Season the tofu all over with salt, then add to the skillet and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate or cutting board and let cool slightly
Step 3
Meanwhile, to the shallot mixture, add the remaining ½ cup olive oil, all the fresh herbs you’re using and the red-pepper flakes. Season generously with salt and stir to combine. (For a smoother sauce, blitz everything in a food processor.)

When the tofu is cool enough to handle, rip it into ½-inch pieces and add to the sauce. Stir to combine. Eat right away, let sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. Re-season with salt and lemon juice as needed, as flavors shift from the fridge.
To save time, skip plucking parsley leaves: Instead, hold onto the stems of a small bunch of parsley with your non-dominant hand. Chop the leaves until you hit the stems, then continue to chop the leaves until finely chopped. Discard or compost the stems (or freeze them for stock).

1-pound bag frozen sliced okra (optional)

Cooked rice, for serving

Sliced scallions and hot sauce, for topping (optional)","607 user ratings","5½ hours","Step 1
In the insert of a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, whisk the flour and oil together until evenly combined. (If your insert doesn’t fit in your microwave, or if it is not microwave-safe, use a large microwave-safe bowl. Never put metal in the microwave.) Microwave on full power for 3 minutes, then whisk well. Using oven mitts, rotate the insert or bowl if your microwave doesn’t rotate. Microwave in 15- to 30-second increments, whisking and rotating after each, until the roux is the color of milky coffee or peanut butter. (Total cooking times can vary from 4 to 15 minutes depending on the strength of your microwave, so keep a close eye on it.) See Tip for stovetop roux instructions.
Step 2
Stir the garlic, celery, onion, bell pepper, tomato paste and salt into the roux until evenly combined. Microwave for 4 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Using mitts, remove the insert and set it into the slow cooker base. (If using a separate container, scrape the mixture out into the slow cooker.) Stir in the bay leaves, paprikas, garlic powder, cayenne, thyme and several generous grinds of black pepper. Stir in the chicken stock and chicken thighs. Cook on low until the chicken is very tender, about 5 hours.
Step 3
About 15 minutes before the gumbo is done, add the frozen okra, if using. Before eating, remove and discard the bay leaves and break the chicken apart into coarse pieces by pressing the chicken against the walls of the insert with a large spoon or spatula. Taste for seasoning and add more black pepper, salt and cayenne if you like.
Step 4
Serve the gumbo in bowls topped with hot rice and scallions. Pass hot sauce at the table if you like.
If you don’t have a microwave, you can make the roux and sautéed vegetables on the stovetop. In a Dutch oven or large skillet, warm the oil over medium-high heat. Sprinkle in the flour, reduce the heat to medium, and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is the color of milky coffee or peanut butter, 15 to 20 minutes. (Adjust the heat as necessary to avoid burning.) Then stir in the garlic, celery, onion, bell pepper, tomato paste and salt, and cook, stirring, until softened, about 8 minutes. Scrape the mixture into the slow cooker and proceed from there.

In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on low speed until combined. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the side of the bowl, then beat on medium-high until very light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. The mixture will lighten in color and become glossy. Beat in the vanilla, salt and cream. (For chocolate or raspberry flavors, see Tips.)
Step 2
Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 days. (If preparing in advance, you’ll want to press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent it from hardening. Bring the frosting back to room temperature to use it.)
To make chocolate buttercream, melt 1 cup/160 grams chopped bittersweet chocolate in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between until melted, or melt over a double boiler. Let cool to room temperature then beat into the buttercream. Makes about 3 cups.
For raspberry buttercream, beat ½ cup (room temperature) raspberry preserves into the buttercream. The mixture may look split. If so, heat the underside of the bowl slightly with a hair dryer, without melting the butter, and continue to mix until smooth. (Alternatively, soak a dish towel in hot water, wring it dry and use it to briefly wrap the base of the bowl.) Makes about 3 cups.

Salt, to taste","225 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 450 degrees.
Step 2
Prepare the biscuits: In a medium bowl, using a wooden spoon, stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Mix together buttermilk and yogurt, add to the dry ingredients and stir to combine.
Step 3
Pour melted butter into an 8-inch glass baking dish and place dough on top of melted butter. Using your hands, spread dough evenly across the dish until it touches the sides. (If the dough starts to stick to your fingers, use a little butter on your fingertips to keep it from sticking.)
Step 4
Run a knife through the dough to score 9 equal squares. Bake until golden brown at the bottom, 20 to 25 minutes. Brush with more butter on top and set aside.
Step 5
While the biscuits bake, make the sausage gravy: Heat a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the sausage and cook until browned, about 10 minutes, stirring and breaking up any large pieces with a wooden spoon or spatula.
Step 6
Add the onion to the skillet and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Step 7
Stir the flour into the sausage mixture and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until it blends into the sausage fat. (You want to make sure it’s cooked enough that the flour taste goes away, but not so cooked that it’s toasted.)
Step 8
Slowly add the chicken stock and bay leaf, stirring the sausage mixture until combined. Continue cooking for about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently.
Step 9
Add the milk and continue stirring. When the gravy begins to simmer, lower the heat to medium-low and cook for 7 minutes, stirring often, until thickened.

Add black pepper, paprika, cayenne and nutmeg (if using); stir to mix well. Add parsley and sage. Remove the bay leaf. Taste and adjust seasoning.

2
large eggs, beaten with a fork

Kosher salt and black pepper
2
slices American cheese

Ketchup and/or hot sauce (optional)","485 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large piece of parchment paper or foil to the stove. Heat a medium (10-inch) nonstick skillet over medium. Grease the skillet generously with butter. Place one side of the roll in the skillet, cut-side down, and toast until golden, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the toasted half to the parchment, cut-side up. Repeat with more butter and the other half of the roll. (The second side will take less time, as the pan gets hotter.)
Step 2
If you’re using beef or turkey bacon, add 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet. Add the bacon and cook over medium until browned and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes per side. As the bacon cooks, press it down with a spatula. (This helps the fat render, producing crunchier bacon.) Turn off the heat and transfer the bacon to the bottom roll. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.
Step 3
Pour the eggs into the skillet, season with salt and pepper and set over medium-low. Using a spatula, pull the egg toward the center and tilt the skillet so the egg runs to the empty part of the skillet. Repeat this all around until the surface of the egg is no longer runny but still shiny. Add the cheese on the top, tearing into smaller pieces for even coverage. Cook, undisturbed, until the top of the egg is matte, just a minute. Remove from heat, fold the egg in half, and then in half again. Transfer to the bottom roll.
Step 4
Add ketchup and hot sauce as desired, then add the top roll and press down. Wrap in the parchment, smush again, and let sit for a couple minutes for all the elements to steam together. Cut in half and eat.

cup vegetable oil
1
pound ground chicken (preferably dark meat)
2
teaspoons minced garlic (from 2 cloves)
2
teaspoons granulated sugar
1
teaspoon minced fresh bird’s-eye chile or other fresh chile (from 1 chile)
8
ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into ½-inch pieces (about 1½ cups)

tablespoons oyster sauce
2
tablespoons fish sauce
1
tablespoon Thai seasoning sauce (such as Golden Mountain; see Tip)
1
cup loosely packed basil leaves (preferably Thai basil or holy basil)

Ground white pepper, to taste

Steamed jasmine rice, for serving
4
crispy fried eggs (optional)","2253 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
Heat a wok or large nonstick skillet over medium-high, then swirl in the oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the ground chicken and cook, actively breaking the chicken up into small pieces, until it is mostly cooked, about 6 minutes.
Step 2
Stir in the garlic, sugar and chile until evenly distributed and fragrant, about 2 minutes, then add the green beans, oyster sauce, fish sauce and Thai seasoning, and cook, stirring constantly, until the chicken is fully cooked, the green beans are crisp-tender and the krapow is glossy, about 2 minutes.
Step 3
Remove from heat, add the basil and a dash of white pepper and toss to combine. If the sauce seems to cling too tightly to the mixture, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to make it loose and glossy.
Step 4
Serve over rice, and top with a crispy fried egg, if desired. Serve with additional Thai seasoning to sprinkle on top, according to taste.
Golden Mountain is made with fermented soybeans, like soy sauce, and imparts sweetness along with its jolt of salinity. It can be purchased in Asian supermarkets or online and lasts indefinitely. A dash of it adds complexity to stir-fries, curries, fried rice and cooked proteins and vegetables.

1
large egg
¼
cup/50 grams granulated sugar, plus more for serving
1
teaspoon ground cardamom
⅛
teaspoon salt (preferably fine sea salt)

Melted ghee, as needed","350 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
In a blender, combine the flour, milk, egg, sugar, cardamom and salt. Add 1 cup water and blend until smooth. Transfer to a big bowl and grab a ladle.
Step 2
Using a paper towel, lightly grease a medium nonstick crepe pan, nonstick skillet or cast-iron griddle with melted ghee and place over medium-high heat until it is well heated. Ladle about ⅓ cup of batter into the pan and gently swirl the pan around to evenly distribute the batter into a thin round. If using a heavier cast-iron griddle, lightly distribute the batter to cover the bottom of the pan using a ladle. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes until the batter is no longer runny and the bottom is brown or until the malawax releases easily from the pan with a spatula.
Step 3
Just before flipping the malawax, drizzle it with ½ teaspoon of melted ghee. Flip the malawax and cook on the second side for about 20 to 30 seconds, or until the edges get crispy and small, golden pockets appear all over the malawax. Flip the malawax onto a plate and sprinkle with your desired amount of sugar.
Step 4
Repeat this process with each malawax until the batter is finished and you have a stack of malawax. Don’t forget to distribute ghee in the pan evenly with a paper towel as needed between each malawax. Malawax is best eaten right away while it’s warm and the edges are still crisp.

"Three Sisters Bean Patties With Raspberry Aioli","Beans,Butternut Squash,Cornmeal,Kidney Bean,Raspberry,Dinner,Main Course,Vegetarian","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","For the Patties
1
small butternut squash (about 1½ pounds)

Olive oil, for brushing squash

Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
1½
cups/275 grams medium-grind white (or yellow) cornmeal, plus more if needed
1
teaspoon baking powder
2
(15-ounce) cans red kidney beans (or other red beans), drained (about 3 cups)
½
sweet onion, minced (about ¾ cup)
¼
cup sunflower butter
2
garlic cloves, minced
1
teaspoon dried sage
For the Raspberry-sage Aioli
6
ounces fresh raspberries, finely chopped (scant ⅔ cup)
1
cup mayonnaise
1
tablespoon maple syrup
1
tablespoon finely chopped fresh sage","306 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Start the patties: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Halve the butternut squash lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. Drizzle the cut squash with oil, season generously with salt and pepper, and place flat side down on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Roast until the skin is sunken and a fork passes through easily, 30 to 40 minutes.
Step 2
While the squash cools, add the cornmeal, baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper to a large bowl; whisk to combine. Scrape and remove ¾ cup squash from its skin with a fork and add to bowl (the remaining squash will keep, refrigerated, for 3 to 4 days). Add the beans, onion, sunflower butter, garlic and dried sage. Stir to combine, then transfer the mixture to a food processor and pulse until uniform. (Though a food processor yields better results, you could also simply mash the ingredients with a masher or your hands until well incorporated.) The mixture should be thick and pliable; if not, add more cornmeal, 1 tablespoon at a time, and mix thoroughly. Cover the mixture and let rest in the fridge for 10 minutes until slightly firmer.
Step 3
While the mixture chills, make the aioli: In a small bowl, combine the chopped raspberries, mayonnaise, maple syrup and sage until well mixed. (Makes 1⅓ cups.) Cover and refrigerate while you cook the patties.
Step 4
Finish the patties: Remove the cornmeal mixture from the fridge. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Using 1 heaping tablespoon (with almost 2 tablespoons of the cornmeal mixture) at a time, begin to shape small 1½- to 2-inch balls, adding them to the prepared baking sheet and pushing each to flatten slightly. Continue until all the dough is used; you should have about 24 patties. Bake on the prepared baking sheet for 20 to 30 minutes, until golden brown and crisp. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving with aioli.

Nước chấm, for serving","180 user ratings","1 hour, plus 1 hour marinating","Step 1
Make the batter: In a large bowl, stir together the rice flour, potato starch, tapioca starch, salt, oil and 4 cups water until there are very few lumps. Allow mixture to set at room temperature for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours (or overnight, covered).
Step 2
While the batter is setting, make the filling: Mix the fish sauce, oyster sauce, bouillon powder, sugar, black pepper and salt into the pork. Cover and refrigerate mixture for 1 hour.
Step 3
Over medium heat, add the vegetable oil to a medium pan. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes, then add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Add the minced wood ear mushrooms and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
Step 4
Add the jicama to the mixture and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Then add the marinated pork and cook, stirring and breaking it up into smaller pieces, until it’s cooked through and beginning to brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
Step 5
Heat a medium (10-inch) nonstick pan with a lid over medium. Stir the batter to blend it evenly (the flours will have sunk to the bottom), then add a thin layer to the pan, about a scant ¼ cup batter, depending on the size of your pan. Allow the batter to spread across the pan and form a round, tilting the pan as necessary, then cover to steam for 30 to 45 seconds until the batter is cooked through and the edges begin to separate from the surface.

Carefully flip the pan over to release the cooked batter onto a cutting board. Add 2 tablespoons of filling to the middle in a horizontal line and using a spatula or your hands, roll the cooked batter to encase the filling. Transfer to a platter or to serving plates. Repeat with the remaining batter and filling.

slices shokupan (milk bread) or any fluffy white sandwich bread
8 to 10
pieces cut fruit (1-inch chunks), such as strawberries, banana, mango and kiwi","285 user ratings","20 minutes plus 1 hour chilling","Step 1
Chill a mixing bowl and the beater attachments of a hand mixer in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. (A metal bowl will chill more quickly than glass.) Meanwhile, in a separate large bowl, mix the mascarpone with the honey until smooth.
Step 2
Place the chilled mixing bowl in another, larger bowl filled with ice water, to keep it cold. Pour the chilled heavy cream in the mixing bowl. (The colder everything is, the less time it will take to whip the cream and the lighter and fluffier it will be.) Using a hand mixer with the chilled beater attachments, beat the cream until stiff enough to hold peaks, 5 to 8 minutes on medium.
Step 3
Add the whipped cream to the mascarpone and gently combine. The mixture should be fairly firm, so it won’t squeeze out the sides of the sandwich when slicing. (If the mixture is too soft, chill briefly until firmer but still spreadable, about 5 minutes.)
Step 4
Take the 4 slices of bread and cut off the crusts on all 4 sides. Using a spatula, spread about ⅓ cup of cream filling on each slice of bread. (It will be thick.)
Step 5
Pat the fruit dry with paper towels to absorb any excess moisture. Arrange the fruit on top of the cream on 2 slices of bread, keeping in mind that you will be cutting along the diagonal and showing off cut sections of fruit. Make a mental note of which diagonal you will be using.
Step 6
Cover the fruit with the remaining cream. Then put the other slice of bread, cream side down, on top of the fruit to make the sandwich.
Step 7
Wrap the sandwich with plastic wrap, very tightly, making sure there’s no air inside. Mark your chosen diagonal on the plastic wrap, so you will know where to cut. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or overnight.
Step 8
Hold a serrated bread knife under hot running water for 15 seconds, then wipe dry. (A warm knife cuts more cleanly than a cold one.) Unwrap the sandwich and cut along your chosen diagonal line. Serve immediately.

Set aside to brine at room temperature until the hard cabbage leaves shrink and become wet and limp (but are still crunchy), 1 to 1½ hours.
Step 2
Rinse the cabbage: Fill the bowl with cold water and swish the leaves around to rinse off the salt (and to clean off any remaining dirt). Lift the leaves out of the water and transfer to a colander. Repeat once or twice, until the cabbage leaves still taste discernibly salted, but not so salty that you can’t eat them like salad. Rinse out the bowl.
Step 3
Make the sauce: To a food processor, add the pear, onion, garlic, ginger and sugar and process until the mixture is so finely chopped that it is almost puréed. Transfer the sauce to the empty bowl and stir in the fish sauce. Cut the scallions into 1-inch-long pieces and thinly slice the daikon and carrot, if using, into coins. Add the vegetables to the sauce. Stir to combine. Add the drained cabbage and toss with clean hands until well combined.
Step 4
Transfer the sauced cabbage to a clean ½-gallon jar, using your hands to gently pack it down. (A few air gaps are fine; they’ll fill with liquid over time.) This amount of cabbage should fill the jar, leaving about an inch of room at the top. Top the jar with any sauce left in the bowl. Loosely close with a lid (see Tip). Wash your hands and rinse off the jar.
Step 5
Let the jar of kimchi begin fermenting on the kitchen counter at room temperature for 2 to 3 days, “burping” it every 12 hours or so, which just means opening the lid to let out any excess build-up of gas. After this, the cabbage should have released even more of its liquid; it’s OK if the liquid doesn’t completely cover the cabbage at this point, though it may. Refrigerate the kimchi to finish fermenting until it’s sour, 2 to 3 weeks and up to 6 months, at which point it will be very, very sour and should be eaten or turned into jjigae. Check (and taste!) the kimchi every 2 to 3 days to familiarize yourself with the fermentation process.
Many containers work for kimchi, but some are better than others. Glass jars with plastic lids work beautifully, as do stainless steel containers with metal lids that lock into place. Plastic containers with locking plastic lids work just fine for this recipe as well. All of these can be found online or at Korean supermarkets and work well for kimchi since the lids aren’t airtight. Avoid using Mason jars with airtight lids since they can explode as gas builds up during the fermentation process.

"Guacamole With Grilled Corn","Dips And Spreads,Avocado,Corn,Cotija,Summer,Vegan,Fourth Of July,Labor Day,Memorial Day","Yield: About 3 cups","2
ears corn, shucked
½
medium yellow or white onion, roughly chopped (scant 1 cup or 4 ounces)
1
serrano or jalapeño chile, seeded and roughly chopped (more or less to taste)
2
cups loosely packed cilantro leaves and fine stems, roughly chopped, plus more for garnish
1
teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
4
medium or 3 large avocados
1
tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice, plus more to taste
4
ounces crumbled Cotija (scant 1 cup)

Tortilla chips, for serving","498 user ratings","25 minutes, plus time for grill to heat","Step 1
Prepare a coal or gas grill so it’s at high heat. Add the corn and cook, turning occasionally, until the kernels are lightly blackened in spots all over, 5 to 15 minutes. When corn is cool enough to handle, hold one ear upright in a large bowl and, using a sharp knife, cut off the kernels. Discard the cob, then repeat with the other ear. Let cool completely before adding to the finished guacamole.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large granite mortar and pestle or molcajete (see Tip), combine the onion, chile, cilantro and salt. Pound into a rough paste, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer the paste to a large bowl.
Step 3
Add the flesh of the avocados and the lime juice. Crush the avocados into a chunky dip using the pestle or the back of a large spoon. Once corn kernels are completely cooled, add them and the Cotija to the large bowl, reserving a little of each for garnish. Fold together the guacamole, corn and cheese, and season to taste with more salt and lime juice. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro, Cotija and corn. Serve immediately with tortilla chips. (Try to eat in one sitting. Leftover guacamole stored in the fridge turns brown quickly.)
A granite mortar and pestle or molcajete crushes plant cells more effectively than a knife or a food processor, which, in turn, lends more flavor to the guacamole. If you don’t have a granite mortar and pestle or molcajete, combine the onion, chile, cilantro and salt in a small bowl and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes to draw out moisture. Transfer to a cutting board and chop very finely with a chef’s knife, then, using the side of the knife, smear and crush the ingredients until they form a paste. Transfer to a large bowl and continue as directed in Step 3.
To broil, heat the broiler to high and adjust an oven rack to 4 to 6 inches below the broiler element. Place the shucked corn on a rimmed baking sheet and broil, turning occasionally, until kernels are lightly blacked in spots all over, 5 to 15 minutes.

Dry-brine the cabbage: Rinse the head of cabbage under cold running water, making sure to get in between the leaves. Trim the root end off the cabbage and cut crosswise into 1-inch-thick slices, carving out any core if it’s especially big and tough. Transfer the cabbage strips to your largest bowl. Sprinkle over the salt and toss with your hands until evenly distributed. Set aside to brine at room temperature until the hard leaves shrink and become wet and limp (but are still crunchy), 1½ to 2 hours.

Make the sauce: To a food processor, add the apple, onion, garlic, ginger, sugar and process until very finely chopped into a fluffy purée. Transfer the sauce to the empty bowl and stir in the gochugaru and fish sauce. Cut the scallions into 1-inch-long pieces and add to the bowl. Cut the carrot into matchsticks: slice crosswise into 1-inch lengths, then thinly slice lengthwise, stack the slices and cut lengthwise again into thin strips. Add to the bowl, along with the pine nuts, if using. Stir to combine. Add the drained cabbage to the sauce and toss with clean hands until well combined.
Step 4
Transfer the sauced cabbage to a clean ½-gallon jar, using your hands to gently pack it down. (A few air gaps are fine; they’ll fill with liquid over time.) This amount of cabbage should leave about an inch of room at the top of the jar. Top the jar with any remaining sauce left behind in the bowl. Loosely close with a lid (see Tip). Wash your hands and rinse off the outside of the jar at this stage.
Step 5
Let the jar of kimchi begin fermenting on the kitchen counter at room temperature for 2 to 3 days, “burping” it every 12 hours or so, which just means opening the lid to let out any excess build-up of gas.

Check (and taste!) the kimchi every 2 to 3 days both to familiarize yourself with the fermentation process but also to allow gas to escape.
⅓ cup of soy sauce plus 1 to 2 tablespoons of doenjang or miso can be used as a vegan substitute for the fish sauce. The flavor won’t be the same, but it will still taste wonderful.

4
garlic cloves, crushed and coarsely chopped

Fish sauce, to taste (optional)
2
scallions, thinly sliced at an angle

Cooked white rice, for serving","202 user ratings","3 hours","Step 1
In a large pot or Dutch oven, combine the pork, ginger and 3 cups of cold water. Season with salt. Bring to a boil over high, then reduce the heat to a simmer, cover and cook until the pork is tender and almost falling apart, about 2 hours. You should have about 2 cups of pork broth in the pot; add more water if you don’t.
Step 2
Stir in the kimchi, onion and garlic and continue simmering until the kimchi is very tender and the pork is absolutely falling apart, about 1 more hour. Taste the broth for seasoning, adding fish sauce as desired; otherwise season with more salt.
Step 3
Right before serving, garnish the top of the stew with the scallions, break the meat up and serve with the rice.
To make this stew in an Instant Pot: Add the pork, ginger, kimchi, onion, garlic and 2 cups cold water to a 3- to 6-quart Instant Pot or other electric pressure cooker. Season with salt. Gently stir and cover with the lid. Pressure-cook on high for 1 hour and let the pressure release naturally. Taste the broth for seasoning, adjusting with fish sauce or salt or both.

½
cup torn basil leaves

Lime wedges, for serving
2
scallions, thinly sliced, for serving","767 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Season chicken all over with salt and pepper. Rub garlic and thyme on chicken, and set aside while preparing the rest of the ingredients.
Step 2
Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter, letting butter melt. Add chicken and sear, undisturbed, until browned on both sides, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate.
Step 3
Over medium heat, add remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the skillet. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the foam subsides and it smells nutty and toasty, 2 to 3 minutes. (Watch carefully to see that it doesn’t burn.) Add corn and a big pinch of salt and black pepper. Sauté until tender and golden brown, 2 minutes.
Step 4
Add chicken back to the skillet. Cover and cook until chicken is cooked through and corn is caramelized, about 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and taste corn, adding more salt and pepper if needed. Stir in basil and squeeze 2 lime wedges over the top. Serve garnished with sliced scallions and more lime wedges.
The least messy way to cut the kernels off an ear of corn is to lay the ear flat on a cutting board and slice off the kernels, turning the cob as you go. Keeping it flat helps prevent the kernels from flying all over the kitchen.

"Sinasir (Fermented Rice Skillet Cakes)","Pancakes,Brown Rice,Instant Yeast,Nigerian,Plan Ahead,Snack,Side Dish,Gluten Free","Yield: 10 cakes","2
cups short-grain brown rice
2
teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
1
tablespoon granulated sugar
1
teaspoon instant yeast

Neutral oil, for frying","84 user ratings","About 3 to 6 hours, plus 24 hours’ fermentation","Step 1
Place rice in a medium bowl and cover with 2 inches of water. Cover the bowl with a dish towel and let soak for 1 to 4 hours. The rice grains should plump and break easily after soaking. Using a mesh strainer, completely drain the soaking liquid and move the grains to a blender. Add in 1½ cups water, and process the soaked rice on high speed until it’s a smooth batter. (Makes 2 cups fermented rice paste.) Move the batter to a clean large bowl, cover with a dish towel, and allow to ferment at room temperature for 24 hours. If you want it rather sour, allow it to ferment for up to 24 hours at room temperature, then cover and transfer to the refrigerator to ferment slowly for up to 1 week.
Step 2
Using a whisk or a spatula to combine, add salt to the bowl of fermented brown rice paste. In a small bowl, stir together the sugar and yeast, and add ¼ cup warm water. Set aside till foamy, about 3 to 5 minutes. Once foamy, mix the yeast mixture into the rice batter, and stir well to combine.
Step 3
Cover and allow to rise until doubled in volume and foamy, about 1 hour. (You can also leave the batter to ferment and develop more flavor by letting it rise slowly in the refrigerator over a 12-hour period.)
Step 4
Gently stir the batter, making sure to get any paste that's settled at the bottom of the bowl. Allow to sit uncovered for another 10 minutes at room temperature before frying.
Step 5
To fry, warm up a small (8-inch) well-seasoned or nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add a teaspoon of oil. Ladle in ⅓ cup batter and tilt the pan to spread to the edges of the pan. Cover the pan with a lid or strip of foil. Cook until the surface of the cake is translucent and dotted with holes, 1½ minutes. Remove the lid and continue cooking until the edges pull away from the pan and the contact surface is a crisp golden brown, 1½ minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and fold the sinasir into a half-moon shape.
Step 6
Repeat Step 5 with the remaining batter, adding ½ teaspoon oil with every new cake and lowering the heat to medium-low as necessary. These can be served savory alongside beef suya, or sweet by drizzling lightly with honey.

8
ounces halloumi, chilled (Vegan? See Tip)
1
(5-ounce) package mixed baby greens","396 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Make the ginger-lime vinaigrette: In a large bowl, stir together the sliced red onion, lime zest, lime juice, ginger, garlic and ¼ cup olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside, letting the red onion marinate and tenderize.
Step 2
Prepare the rice: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high in a large nonstick skillet. Stir in the turmeric. Add the rice and cook, stirring quickly to coat the rice evenly, about 1 minute. (No need to break it up entirely; clumps are encouraged for texture.)
Step 3
Season generously with salt and pepper, and let rice sit, undisturbed, until crispy underneath and toasted in spots, 2 to 3 minutes. Gently turn the rice with a spatula, trying to preserve any clumps, and cook another 3 minutes, until crispy on the second side. (The rice should be almost equal parts crispy and chewy, and evenly stained by the turmeric.) Transfer to a large, paper towel-lined rimmed baking sheet, set in an even layer and let cool.
Step 4
Prepare the halloumi: Chop the halloumi into ¾-inch cubes, then pat them dry using a kitchen towel or paper towels. Wipe out the skillet, then heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Add the cubed halloumi in an even layer and cook, stirring frequently, until golden at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. (Sturdy but delicate, halloumi needs to cook quickly at a high temperature so it sears without fully melting down and losing its shape. Stir attentively!) Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with pepper.
Step 5
When ready to eat, add the greens to the vinaigrette, toss to coat and season with salt and pepper. Transfer to a wide, shallow bowl or dish. (You want a big surface area to accommodate the toppings.) Scatter with the crispy rice clusters and hot halloumi. Serve immediately.
If you don’t eat dairy, sliced or chopped avocado is a suitable substitute for the halloumi. It’s not quite as textural, but it will provide great richness and heft to the salad.

In a medium saucepan, combine the rice, 1 teaspoon salt and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Turn off the heat and let rice rest, covered, until ready to eat. (Alternatively, cook rice in a rice cooker or however you like to cook rice.)
Step 2
While the rice cooks, make the chickpeas: Add the chile crisp to a large (12-inch), nonstick skillet and heat over medium. (Make sure there is enough oil — not just solids — covering the bottom of the skillet. If your chile oil is mostly solids, add a little neutral oil to cover to skillet.)
Step 3
Add the chickpeas and a pinch of sugar, stir to coat in the oil, then spread into an even layer. Cook until the chickpeas start to sizzle, 2 to 3 minutes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and crisp all over, 7 to 10 minutes more. If the pan looks dry at any point, add a drizzle of neutral oil (or more chile crisp if you want it really, really spicy).
Step 4
While the chickpeas and rice cook, stir together the tomatoes, celery, celery leaves, cilantro, soy sauce and a pinch of sugar in a medium bowl.
Step 5
When the rice and chickpeas are ready, divide the rice among plates or bowls. Pour some of the liquid from the bowl of tomatoes over the rice, then top with the tomatoes and celery, the chickpeas and more chile crisp, if desired.

3
pounds ripe tomatoes (any mix of plum, grape, cherry and Campari), coarsely chopped

Salt
1
pound thin spaghetti","1195 user ratings","1 hour 10 minutes","Step 1
Add the olive oil and garlic to a large Dutch oven or high-sided skillet. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook the garlic, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly golden, and small rapid bubbles form around the cloves, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove the garlic from the pot and discard (or eat).
Step 2
Carefully and gently lower the chopped tomatoes into the hot oil and cook, stirring constantly, until the tomatoes let off some liquid and the sauce starts to bubble steadily. Season generously with salt. Lower the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes break down and the sauce reduces significantly, about 40 minutes.
Step 3
Set a metal sieve, strainer or food mill over a medium bowl. Carefully pour in the tomato sauce. If using a sieve or strainer, push the sauce through with a spoon or flexible spatula, until all that remains are seeds and skins. Be sure to repeatedly scrape off the valuable pulp collecting on the bottom of the sieve (by holding the sieve down against the edge of the bowl and pulling it back). You should have about 2 cups of sauce in the bowl. Taste and add more salt, if needed, then return the sauce to the Dutch oven.
Step 4
Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain the pasta and add to the sauce.

Turn the heat to high and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce reduces slightly and the pasta is well coated but not drowned in the sauce, about 2 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit so the pasta can absorb the sauce further, about 5 more minutes. Serve immediately.

For Assembly
12 to 16
corn tortillas

Salsas, for serving","299 user ratings","35 minutes, plus 2 hours’ marinating","Step 1
Make the steak seasoning: Tear the cooled chile into small pieces and place in a spice grinder, along with the peppercorns, coriander and cumin. Pulse until everything is roughly ground. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in the garlic, onion and salt.
Step 2
Marinate the steak: In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, orange juice, Worcestershire sauce, oil, cilantro, scallions, garlic and 1 tablespoon steak seasoning. Place the steak in a resealable freezer bag or shallow dish, and pour in the marinade. Make sure the steak is evenly coated. Seal the bag, or cover the dish and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Step 3
Heat an outdoor charcoal or gas grill to medium, or set an indoor grill pan over medium.
Step 4
Transfer the steak to a baking sheet lined with foil (discard the marinade). Sprinkle the remaining steak seasoning all over the steak. Grill for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare, 4 to 5 minutes for medium and 6 to 7 minutes for well done. Remove the steak from the grill (but leave the grill on) and let rest on a cutting board for about 10 minutes before cutting into thin, small slices.
Step 5
While the steak rests, warm the tortillas: Reduce the grill heat to medium-low. Place the tortillas on the grill and cook until they start to blister but are not blackened, 1 to 3 minutes. Stack in a clean kitchen towel and wrap well. Serve warm, with the sliced steak and salsas.
If you have preground spices, you can make the seasoning with 2 teaspoons ground guajillo chile, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, ½ teaspoon ground coriander, ¼ teaspoon ground cumin, ¾ teaspoon kosher salt, 2 teaspoons garlic powder and 2 teaspoons onion powder.

¼
cup thinly sliced red onion or shallot
⅓
cup crumbled feta
½
cup chopped soft herbs, such as mint, basil or cilantro, plus more for garnish","291 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Light a charcoal or gas grill or heat the broiler. Make the fire as hot as it will get and, if using a broiler, put the rack close to the heat source.
Step 2
While the grill heats up, lightly crack the coriander seeds in a mortar and pestle, or with the side of a knife on a cutting board. (Careful: They can roll around.) Put them in a small dry skillet over medium heat and toast, shaking the pan once or twice until fragrant, 1 to 3 minutes. Pour into a small bowl.
Step 3
Using a Microplane or other grater, grate zest from both limes straight into the bowl with coriander. Grate in the garlic (no need to wash the grater in between), then add the chile and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Whisk in oil.
Step 4
Pat shrimp dry, then transfer to a medium bowl and season with a pinch each salt and black pepper. Give the coriander mixture a stir, then pour half of it over the shrimp, reserving the rest for the salad. Toss shrimp to coat and set aside while preparing the other ingredients.
Step 5
Cut the zested limes in half, squeeze out 2 tablespoons juice and whisk into the coriander mixture to make a dressing. Cut leftover lime into wedges.
Step 6
Arrange the shrimp in a grill basket or on skewers (or just on a sheet pan if broiling), and grill or broil shrimp until well browned on one side, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until just opaque and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the shrimp to a plate and squeeze a wedge of lime all over.
Step 7
In a large bowl, combine melon, cucumber, onion, feta and herbs. Pour in coriander dressing and toss to combine. Taste, and add more salt or lime juice to taste. Top melon salad with grilled shrimp and more herbs, if you’d like.

Tortilla chips

Any combination of hot sauce, cilantro, queso fresco, for topping","532 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Heat a broiler with a rack 4 to 6 inches from the heat source. Line a sheet pan with foil and arrange the plum tomatoes on it, cut sides up. Add the onion, cherry tomatoes, jalapeños and garlic, distributing them evenly, then broil for 15 minutes, checking and rotating the pan every 5 minutes to ensure the vegetables char evenly. (You want the vegetables to be blackened in many spots, slumped and sizzling. Many of the cherry tomatoes will have burst.) Let the vegetables sit 1 or 2 minutes, until just cool enough to handle.
Step 2
Warm the vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Transfer the charred onion to a cutting board, roughly chop it, and add it to the pot, along with the salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, discard the garlic skins then chop the garlic, jalapeños and plum tomatoes. Lift two sides of the foil and tip the cherry tomatoes and any juices into a bowl; set aside for the salsa.
Step 4
Add the chopped garlic, jalapeño and plum tomatoes to the pot, and cook, stirring often, until slightly reduced and glossy, about 2 minutes. Add the tomato paste, cumin, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder, and cook, stirring constantly, until toasted and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chicken thighs, carrots and broth, and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits.
Step 5
Increase the heat to high, cover the pot and let the soup come to a boil. Uncover the pot, reduce the heat to medium-high for a medium-brisk simmer, and cook, stirring once or twice, until the chicken and carrots are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 6
Meanwhile, gently fold the avocado into the cherry tomatoes; add the juice of half the lime and season to taste with salt.
Step 7
With a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the chicken to a bowl. Coarsely shred and break up the meat with a fork, then add it back into the pot. Squeeze in the juice of the remaining half lime, and add more salt if necessary.
Step 8
Serve the soup in bowls topped with crushed tortilla chips and spoonfuls of the tomato-avocado salsa. Pass hot sauce, queso fresco and/or cilantro at the table, if desired.

1
cup/100 grams seedless muscat grapes
2
passion fruits, halved and insides scraped, or ¼ cup passion fruit purée","321 user ratings","1¼ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat the oven to 350 degrees and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
Prepare the meringue: Add the egg whites to the base of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place and beat on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. With the machine running, add the superfine sugar, a spoonful at a time, until the meringue is stiff and glossy, about 4 minutes more.
Step 3
Use a spatula to gently fold the cornstarch and vinegar into the meringue until evenly mixed through. Transfer the meringue to your prepared baking sheet and use a spatula to spread it into an oblong shape that’s roughly 14 inches long and 10 inches wide. Use your spatula to create spiky peaks across the surface of the meringue for a more rustic look.
Step 4
Place the meringue in the oven, then immediately turn the temperature down to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for 1 hour, until dry on the outside but chewy through the center. Leave to cool at room temperature, about 30 minutes. Don’t worry if it cracks in places.
Step 5
Meanwhile, make the syrup: Add the orange juice, vinegar, rosemary sprigs and superfine sugar to a small saucepan and place it over a medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, then cook for 6 to 7 minutes, until reduced by about half. Off the heat, stir in the lemon juice and set aside to cool completely. It’ll thicken to a maple syrup consistency as it cools.
Step 6
Make the cream: Add all the ingredients to the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Beat on medium-high speed until soft-medium peaks form, 1½ to 2 minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Step 7
Prepare the fruit topping: Use a mandoline to finely shave one side of the nectarine to get very thin rounds until you hit the pit, then shave the opposite side. Chop off the narrower ends and save these to snack on. Repeat with the plums. Set both aside on a large plate, separately. Use a small serrated knife to finely slice the grapes and the kumquats into thin rounds of around the same thickness. Set the sliced kumquats on the same plate, discarding the pits.
Step 8
To assemble, use the parchment paper to help you transfer the meringue to a large serving platter or board. (Alternatively, you can serve it right from the sheet pan.) Top the cooled meringue with the cream by dolloping and spreading it across the meringue using the back of a spoon, leaving a 1-inch gap from the edges. Artfully top with the nectarines, plums, grapes and kumquats. Dot with the passion fruit. Remove the rosemary sprigs from the syrup and place these on top of the fruit then pour the syrup all over the fruit. Lastly, sprinkle with the extra chopped rosemary. Serve right away, or within the hour, as the meringue will soften as it sits.

teaspoon ground black pepper
½
cup mayonnaise
1
tablespoon Old Bay seasoning
4
toasted hamburger buns

Lemon wedges, for serving

Shredded iceberg lettuce and sliced dill pickles","558 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Heat a grill to medium and oil the grates.
Step 2
In a food processor, pulse the shrimp a few times just until finely chopped and a coarse paste forms. Transfer to a large bowl and add the cod, ¼ cup of the scallions, the salt and pepper, and mix until well blended. (Hands work best.) Moisten your hands with water, then form the mixture into 4 (½-inch-thick) patties. Coat patties lightly with the oil.
Step 3
Grill the burgers until lightly charred and just cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. (Resist the temptation to prod or flip the burgers unnecessarily. They will release easily once they are cooked on each side.)
Step 4
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Old Bay and the remaining 2 tablespoons scallions; mix well.
Step 5
Smear some of the Old Bay mayonnaise on the buns. Top each bottom bun with a burger and squeeze lemon on top. Top with some of the lettuce and pickles, close the burgers and enjoy.

(3-pound) boneless lamb shoulder roast

Salt and pepper
1
tablespoon roughly chopped garlic
4
rosemary sprigs
6
bay leaves
½
teaspoon ground allspice
½
teaspoon ground cloves
1
tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
1

Red-pepper flakes
2
tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish
2
tablespoons chopped dill, for garnish
2
tablespoons chopped mint, for garnish","274 user ratings","3½ to 4 hours","Step 1
Prepare a covered gas or charcoal grill for medium indirect heat, or heat an oven to 325 degrees.
Step 2
If the roast is tied, remove netting or string. Lay the roast on a work surface and open it flat. Sprinkle the insides with salt, pepper and chopped garlic. Reroll the roast (no need to tie it), leaving the garlic inside. Place the roast seam side down in a small roasting pan or 9-by-13-inch baking dish just big enough to hold it.
Step 3
Tuck rosemary and bay leaves under the meat. Season the top with salt and pepper, allspice and cloves. Drizzle with olive oil and smear the oil over the surface. Add 1 cup water to the pan.
Step 4
Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and place in a covered gas or charcoal grill, on set up for medium indirect heat, or in a 325-degree oven. Cook until the meat is fork-tender, 3 to 3½ hours. (Be sure to remove the foil after about 2 ½ hours, so that the meat browns.) From time to time, check that there’s still about 2 inches of liquid at the bottom of the roasting pan, adding more water as necessary. When the meat is done, set aside until cool enough to handle, then tear into large shreds, reserving any of the remaining concentrated pan juices and skim the fat.
Step 5
Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to the boil and add salt. Blanch beans for about 1 minute, then remove spread out on a baking sheet to cool.
Step 6
When ready to serve, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a wide skillet over medium heat. When hot, add blanched beans and cook for 1 minute, then add a pinch of red-pepper flakes, the pan juices and shredded meat, and cook just a bit longer, until everything is warmed through, tossing well. Taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer to a serving dish. Sprinkle with parsley, dill and mint.

"S’mores","Finger Foods,Chocolate,Graham Cracker,Marshmallow,Easy,Quick,Snack,Dessert","Yield: As many as you like","
Neutral cooking oil, such as canola

Regular or jumbo marshmallows

Graham crackers, split into even squares, or saltine crackers

Milk or dark chocolate bars, at room temperature

Flaky or coarse salt (optional)","119 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Expertly assemble and ignite a campfire. (Watch a how-to video, if you need.)
Step 2
Procure roasting skewers: Metal skewers are the way to go, as they won’t leave bits of tree bark behind in your marshmallow. (Flammable twigs and wooden skewers aren’t the safest options for younger kids.) Double-pronged roasting sticks designed for marshmallows will keep marshmallows secure as they soften over the flames, but extra-long metal skewers work just fine.
Step 3
Make a s’more: With a paper towel, rub a little neutral cooking oil over the end of the metal skewer where the marshmallows will go; this keeps the sugary pillows from sticking. Skewer 2 regular marshmallows or 1 jumbo marshmallow onto the rod.
Step 4
Top a cracker with 1 or 2 squares of chocolate, depending on size and personal preference. Sprinkle a little salt over the chocolate, if you like.
Step 5
Roast your marshmallows: Resist the urge to immediately plunge them directly into the flames. Hold the marshmallows over the top of the flames, and roast, rotating often, until the marshmallows are golden, gooey in the center and slumped slightly down the skewer, 2 to 3 minutes. Lower the marshmallows into the flames, let them catch fire briefly and then carefully blow them out. A perfect marshmallow is a burnished marshmallow, after all.
Step 6
Immediately place the charred, skewered marshmallows on the chocolate-topped cracker. Take the unadorned cracker and press down as you pull out the skewer so that the gooey marshmallows ooze over the chocolate and out of the edges of the crackers. Devour immediately. Repeat, repeat, repeat.

Warm lavash or pita bread, for serving
3
tablespoons chopped dill, for garnish
3
tablespoons parsley, for garnish
3
tablespoons chopped mint leaves, for garnish","176 user ratings","30 to 40 minutes","Step 1
Set the whole, unpeeled eggplant directly over a bed of hot coals, over the open flame of a gas burner at full blast or under the broiler. With a paring knife or skewer, poke a few holes into the eggplant to allow steam to escape. Let the skin of the eggplant blacken and blister, turning the eggplant continuously until it is soft, collapsed and completely charred, about 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 2
Set the cooked eggplant on a chopping board, and, when cool enough to handle, cut in half from top to bottom. Let cool to room temperature (about 15 minutes), then scoop out flesh with a spoon, discarding any large seed pockets. Tear or roughly chop eggplant flesh and put in a medium bowl.
Step 3
Add 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, tahini, garlic, yogurt, cumin, cayenne, cinnamon, and salt and pepper. Beat mixture with a fork, leaving it somewhat rough. Set aside to let flavors meld at room temperature, then taste and adjust seasoning. Transfer to a serving dish.
Step 4
Put diced onion in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add pomegranate molasses, sumac and 1 teaspoon lemon juice. Stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil.
Step 5
Add chopped tomatoes and fold into onion mixture, sprinkling with a bit more salt, if necessary. Transfer to a serving dish and top with walnuts.
Step 6
Spread eggplant mixture on pieces of warm lavash or pita, keeping the edges clear, and arrange on a platter. Spoon some of the tomato mixture onto each piece. Sprinkle dill, parsley and mint liberally over it all.

pounds eggplant (1 large), base and stem trimmed
3
tablespoons soy sauce
1
tablespoon black vinegar (such as Chinkiang vinegar)
1
tablespoon chile crisp or chile oil (preferably one that contains Sichuan peppercorns)
1

1
(1-inch) piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped (about 1 tablespoon)
3
tablespoons neutral oil such as canola or grapeseed

Rice, to serve","904 user ratings","20 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Set up a wide, deep skillet or wok with a steamer insert, bamboo steamer or stainless steel trivet (see Tip). Find a heatproof plate that fits into your cooking vessel. Add about 1 to 2 inches of water (making sure it won’t touch the bottom of the plate), cover with a lid (or sheet pan or aluminum foil) that fully encloses the steamer, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
Step 2
Meanwhile, slice the eggplant into ½-inch-thick circles, then slice each disk into ½-inch strips. Arrange the eggplant pieces on the heatproof plate, stacking them but leaving some gaps to allow the steam to reach all sides of the eggplant.
Step 3
Carefully place the plate of eggplant into the steamer insert or bamboo steamer, or on top of the trivet. Cover and steam for 9 to12 minutes, until the flesh is easily pierced with a fork, but still firm enough to hold its shape. Carefully transfer the eggplant to a colander set in the sink to cool and drain.
Step 4
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, black vinegar, chile crisp and granulated sugar.
Step 5
When the eggplant is cool to the touch, transfer it to a shallow serving bowl or a rimmed plate. Pile the garlic, scallions and ginger in the center of the eggplant; don’t scatter.
Step 6
In a small pan, heat the oil on medium-high for 2 to 3 minutes; the oil is hot enough if it bubbles when a wooden chopstick or spoon is inserted. Very carefully pour the hot oil over the ginger, garlic and scallions; it will sizzle and become very fragrant.
Step 7
Pour the soy sauce mixture over the eggplant. Serve warm, at room temperature or cold, with rice.
If you don’t have a trivet, you can use stainless steel cookie cutters or roll up several balls of foil to rest the plate on. Skillet size can vary, but it should be large and deep enough to hold whichever steaming setup you use.

1
cup fresh ricotta (optional)

Fresh basil leaves (or other tender herbs, such as dill, mint or oregano), chopped capers and lemon, for garnish (optional)","182 user ratings","15 minutes, plus grill heating","Step 1
Prepare the grill for direct grilling and heat over high.
Step 2
Working on a large baking sheet, brush the zucchini all over with oil, then season generously with salt and pepper.
Step 3
Once the grill is heated, add the zucchini to the grates in an even layer, leaving about 1 inch between to avoid crowding. Cook, uncovered, until grill-marked and crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes per side. (The zucchini should tenderize in just the amount of time it takes to develop grill marks.)
Step 4
In a small bowl, stir the ricotta, if using, with a couple tablespoons of water until extra creamy; season with salt and pepper. Spread the ricotta mixture on a platter, then top with the grilled zucchini, piling it organically to gain some height. Though you need no garnish, you can top with fresh herbs, capers, a flurry of lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice if you are feeling fancy. Drizzle with olive oil and serve warm or at room temperature.

teaspoon fresh lemon juice
½
cup panko bread crumbs

Sliced baguette (optional), for serving","119 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Heat the broiler with the rack 6 to 8 inches from the heat source.
Step 2
Heat oil in a large, deep skillet over medium-high. Add onion, bell pepper and jalapeño. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are lightly browned at the edges, 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute.
Step 3
Deglaze the pan by adding chicken stock and stirring and scraping up browned bits. Add heavy cream and cream cheese and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cream cheese is melted. Add ½ cup shito and stir to combine, then stir in collards. Reduce heat to medium and simmer rapidly, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced to a thick, creamy consistency that coats the greens without being soupy, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 4
Remove from heat and add 1½ cups Cheddar and the lemon juice. Stir until cheese melts. Season to taste with salt and pepper. You can keep the dip in the skillet if the pan is ovenproof, or transfer the dip to a 2-quart baking dish and spread evenly. Combine panko with the remaining ½ cup Cheddar and sprinkle over the dip.
Step 5
Broil until golden on top, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from oven and spoon remaining 2 tablespoons shito over dip. Serve hot or warm, with baguette, if you’d like.
Shito is a Ghanian chile sauce available in West African markets and online.
This is a great use of leftover braised collard greens. Chop the greens more finely if the pieces are large and include any shredded meat if you’d like. You also can use the braising liquid in place of the chicken stock above. If you’re using canned collard greens, look for the seasoned variety from Glory Foods; this recipe uses one drained 27-ounce can. If you’re using frozen collard greens, you need 2 pounds.

teaspoon baking soda
¾
teaspoon fine sea salt
1½
cups/195 grams all-purpose flour","125 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 2
Make the topping: In an oven-safe 10-inch skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add the brown sugar, lemon juice and salt, and whisk until the brown sugar melts, 1 to 2 minutes.
Step 3
Let cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture starts to smell like caramel and darkens slightly, about 1 minute longer. (Don’t walk away or the mixture may burn.) The mixture will clump and separate, but that's OK.
Step 4
Add fruit and nuts, gently tossing to coat with the caramel. Remove from heat and arrange fruit into an even layer on bottom of skillet. Ignore any sugar clumps; they will dissolve during baking.
Step 5
Make the cake: In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest until thoroughly combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time. Add sour cream and whisk until well mixed. Sprinkle in baking powder, baking soda and salt into the batter, one at a time, and whisking vigorously after each addition. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in flour until just incorporated. The mixture will be lumpy, but that’s OK. Don’t overmix. Scrape batter into the skillet over the fruit and spread evenly.
Step 6
Bake until surface is deeply browned all over (with darker brown edges) and the fruit is lightly bubbling along the sides of the skillet, about 35 to 45 minutes, rotating halfway through. A toothpick inserted into cake will come out clean.
Step 7
Once the cake is out of the oven, immediately run a butter knife or offset spatula along the edge of the skillet. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes to cool slightly. Carefully invert cake into serving platter. If some fruit or nuts stick to bottom of the skillet, gently remove them using offset spatula or knife and place back onto cake. Let cake cool until the fruit topping sets, at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, before serving. Cake is best served on the day it is baked.
Since you’ll need the lemon juice for the topping and the grated zest for the cake, it’s best to zest the lemon before you cut it and juice it.
You can substitute an equal amount of drained canned pineapple for fresh.

Bake until the surface is deeply browned all over (with darker brown edges) and the fruit is lightly bubbling along the sides of the skillet, about 35 to 45 minutes, rotating halfway through. A toothpick inserted into cake will come out clean.
Step 8
Once the cake is out of the oven, immediately run a butter knife or offset spatula around the edge of the skillet. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes to cool slightly. Carefully invert cake into serving platter. If some berries stick to bottom of skillet, gently remove using offset spatula or knife and place back onto cake. Let cake cool until the fruit topping sets, at least 30 minutes to 1 hour, before serving. Cake is best served on the day it is baked.
Since you’ll need the lemon juice for the topping and the grated zest for the cake, it’s best to zest the lemon before you cut it and juice it.

In a bowl, whisk the eggs with ½ teaspoon salt.
Step 2
Heat a large wok or 12-inch well-seasoned cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high. When hot, add 1 tablespoon of oil, then pour in the beaten egg. Cook for 15 to 30 seconds, allowing the bottom to set slightly, before stirring and turning until just set. Break up the egg slightly, then remove from the wok and set aside.
Step 3
Heat the wok over high. Add 2 tablespoons of oil, along with the onions, and stir-fry for 1 minute, until slightly softened. Add the garlic and bird’s-eye chiles and stir for 15 to 30 seconds, until fragrant. Next, add the tomatoes and 1 teaspoon of salt, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, tossing every now and then, until the tomatoes are softened. (Reduce heat to medium-high if it starts getting too smoky or the garlic begins to scorch.)
Step 4
Add the rice, soy sauce and half the basil, and season with 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, to taste. Reduce heat to medium-high and stir-fry for 5 to 6 minutes, allowing the rice to soak up the tomato juices. As the liquid cooks off, the rice will char (though less so if using a nonstick pan) and develop some smoky flavors.
Step 5
Add the egg and remaining basil and toss for 1 minute. Turn off the heat and check seasonings, adding some black pepper and more salt if needed. Serve immediately.
If using cherry tomatoes, cut up 5 or 6 of them to add moisture during cooking. The rest can be added whole, as they will burst during the latter part of cooking.

Toppings (such as shredded iceberg, sliced onion, tomato and pickles) and condiments (mayonnaise, barbecue sauce or mustard), as desired","302 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Heat the grill to medium-high. Lightly grease a plate and set aside. Coarsely grate ¼ cup onion; reserve the remaining onion. In a medium bowl, mix the turkey, grated onion and 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce. Form 4 patties about 4 ½ inches wide (about 5 ounces each). Press a small dimple in the center of each patty, then place the burgers on the plate and refrigerate until firm (at least 5 minutes or, covered, up to 2 days).
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the remaining 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce with the mayonnaise; season with 1 teaspoon each of salt and pepper.
Step 3
When ready to grill, dip the reserved onion in oil. Clean the grates with a grill brush, then grease the grates with the oiled onion. (This perfumes the grill and your patties.) Lightly coat the tops of the burgers with some of the mayo mixture (about ½ teaspoon per patty).
Step 4
Grill the burgers, mayo side down, until well browned and patties release from the grates, 4 to 6 minutes. (If flare-ups occur, move to an area of the grill where there are no flames underneath. For a gas grill, close the lid between flips, listening and keeping an eye out for flare-ups.) Spread mayo mixture on the tops of the patties, then flip and grill on the second side until cooked through, another 4 to 6 minutes.
Step 5
Transfer to a plate and let rest for at least 5 minutes. Grill the cut sides of the buns until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. Build burgers on the buns with the patties and desired toppings and condiments.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and ½ teaspoon salt; set aside.

In a medium (10-inch) nonstick skillet, heat 1 tablespoon butter over medium-high. When foaming, add the bell pepper and onion, season lightly with salt and pepper and stir to coat in the butter. Shake into an even layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, 2 to 3 minutes.
Step 3
Add the ham and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to another medium bowl, add the cheese, and stir to combine.
Step 4
Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-low. Add ½ tablespoon butter and swirl to coat the pan. Whisk the egg mixture and pour half into the skillet. Cook without touching until the eggs around the edges of the pan are set, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Using a spatula, slightly pull the edge of the omelet in toward the center and, while holding the spatula in place, tilt the pan so that the egg runs to the empty skillet. Repeat this around the edge of the whole circle until the surface is nearly set but still shiny. (No runny egg will travel when you tilt the pan.)
Step 5
Spoon half the vegetable mixture onto half the egg, cover the skillet with a lid or baking sheet, and cook until the egg is set and the cheese is melted, 1 to 3 minutes. Run the spatula around the edges, then fold the naked half over the filling. Slide the omelet onto a plate, then repeat with the remaining butter, egg and filling.

In a large pot of salted water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Before draining, reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large deep skillet, melt the butter over medium heat, then add the shallot. Cook, stirring constantly, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
Step 3
Deglaze the skillet by adding the white wine and stirring to loosen any browned bits, and season with 2 teaspoons salt and the pepper. Let simmer until slightly reduced, about 1 minute.
Step 4
Slip the kimchi into the skillet and cook until the cabbage is slightly wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and toss well to coat.
Step 5
Once the pasta is incorporated, remove from the heat, add the kimchi juice, egg yolks and cheese, and toss vigorously to coat the pasta. If the pasta seems dry, add some reserved pasta cooking water. Divide among four bowls and top with the spinach, more Parmesan and a sprinkle of gochugaru.
If your kimchi doesn’t have enough accompanying juice, Ms. Meyer suggests squeezing the kimchi a bit to wring out more. The kimchi will also lose a bit of juice after it’s chopped, so make sure to use that as well.

4
sturdy white fish fillets or steaks (about 6 ounces each), such as halibut, red snapper, sea bass or swordfish

Salt and pepper

Olive oil","147 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Make the sauce: Toast the Timur pepper in a dry skillet over medium heat. When the pods are fragrant but not yet darker brown, remove them from the heat and let cool. Using a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle, crush into a fine powder, along with the white peppercorns.
Step 2
In a small bowl, whisk together the vinegar, chiles, marjoram, juice, garlic and the freshly ground Timur and white pepper. Let sit for 30 minutes for the flavors to meld, then gradually whisk in the olive oil. Add salt. Taste and add more of whichever seasonings you like, whisking as you go. Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
Step 3
Make the fish: Pat the fish dry and season on both sides with salt and pepper. If cooking on the stovetop, coat a skillet with oil and heat over medium-high. (The skillet should be large enough to hold all the fillets with space between them. If it isn’t, work in batches.) Carefully add the fish to the hot oil and pan-fry the fish until browned, about 3 minutes on each side. (Gently probe the fish with a fork; if it flakes, it’s done.) Remove from the heat and transfer to plates.
Step 4
If grilling, heat a grill to medium-high. Generously brush or rub the fish with olive oil to coat. Place on the hot grill grates, skin side down if there’s skin and cover if using a gas grill. Cook until the fish releases easily from the grate, about 3 minutes. For thinner fillets, the flesh will be just opaque throughout and starting to gape and the fillets don’t need to be flipped. Simply transfer them to plates. For thick fillets or steaks, carefully flip the fish and cook until just opaque throughout, 2 to 3 minutes more, then transfer to plates. Spoon the sauce over the fish and serve.
Timur pepper, also sold as Timut pepper, belongs to a family of spices (including Sichuan and Sansho pepper) that leave a tingly sensation on the tongue. It has a unique citrus flavor and is sold at some markets and also available online from Burlap & Barrel, as are fermented white peppercorns.
If you don’t have Moscatel vinegar, substitute 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, adjust the amount of orange or tangerine juice to 1 tablespoon, and add 1 teaspoon orange zest and ¼ teaspoon sugar.

cup red wine vinegar","127 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Mix together 1 teaspoon thyme leaves, garlic powder, ginger, salt and pepper. Season the fish with the mixture.
Step 2
In a large skillet over medium, heat oil until really hot but not smoking, about 3 to 5 minutes, and add the fish flesh-side down. Cook until the flesh gets a little color, about 5 minutes. Flip, then continue cooking until the skin is crisp. Remove fish and set aside on a serving platter. Drain oil, leaving about 2 to 3 tablespoons in the skillet.
Step 3
Return the skillet to the stove. Add the bay leaf and fresh ginger, and sauté over medium heat until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

Add bell peppers, onion, carrots, Scotch bonnet chile, sugar, Worcestershire sauce, allspice and the remaining thyme leaves, and continue cooking, stirring, for about 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute.
Step 5
Add vinegar, and stir to combine all the ingredients. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary. Let it simmer for about 2 minutes, until the vegetables soften but still retain bite, and spoon over fish. (Leave the allspice berries or pickling spice in the topping. Simply eat around them.)
You can also turn this into a sandwich. Mix together some mayonnaise, fresh chopped cilantro and lime to taste. Then spread that sauce evenly onto a soft hero bread or crusty French bread, and add the fillets. Serve with sweet plantain fries.

Mix the shrimp, Shaoxing wine, 1 teaspoon cornstarch and a pinch of salt in a bowl until the shrimp are evenly coated. Let stand while you prepare the other ingredients.
Step 2
Stir the sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, Sichuan pepper and remaining teaspoon cornstarch in a separate bowl. Dice the bell pepper and thinly slice the garlic. Have all your ingredients ready next to the stove.
Step 3
Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat for 15 seconds. Add the peanuts and stir until browned in spots, 30 to 60 seconds. Add the bell pepper and garlic, and sprinkle with salt. Cook, stirring, until the pepper is bright and the garlic starts to become translucent, about 30 seconds. Add the chiles and stir well, then add the shrimp with its marinade. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are curled and just opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.

Add the scallions and stir until glossy, about 15 seconds, then add the sauce. Cook, stirring, until the sauce thickens and coats everything evenly, about 1 minute. If any of the starchy sauce has stuck to the bottom of the pan, add a splash of water and scrape up any browned bits. Taste and add more Sichuan pepper if you’d like. Immediately transfer to a dish and serve hot.

"Celery Victor Salad","Project,Salads And Dressings,Anchovy Fillet,Celery,Mustard Seed,Scallion,Spigarello,Appetizer,Side Dish","Yield: 6 servings","For the Braised Celery and Scallions
2
tablespoons olive oil
2
large carrots, peeled, roughly chopped, then pulsed in a food processor until minced
1½
quarts/48 ounces vegetable stock
1
lemon, quartered
12
large fresh thyme sprigs
2

1
head of celery, fresh green leaves reserved; stalks separated, trimmed and halved crosswise
12
scallions, trimmed and halved crosswise, whites and greens separated
For the Pickled Mustard Seeds
½
cup white wine vinegar
2½
tablespoons yellow mustard seeds
2
tablespoons granulated sugar
1½
tablespoons finely minced shallot
1
tablespoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
For the Anchovy-garlic Paste
6
medium jarred anchovies in oil
1
tablespoon brined capers
1
large garlic clove, finely grated
1
teaspoon red-pepper flakes
4
teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
For Serving
6
cups spigarello (or baby kale, or trimmed Tuscan kale), torn into bite-size pieces
1
cup shaved Parmesan (about 4 ounces), plus more to taste
1
cup flat-leaf parsley leaves
4
teaspoon sherry vinegar mixed with 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more to taste","331 user ratings","2½ hours, plus chilling","Step 1
Prepare the stock for the braised celery and scallions: In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-low. Add the carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the stock and bring to a boil over high. Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the carrots are soft and impart their sweetness, about 30 minutes. Strain liquid, discarding solids, and return to the pot.
Step 2
While the stock simmers, make the pickled mustard seeds: In a small pot, combine the vinegar, mustard seeds, sugar, shallot and salt. Stir to combine, then cook over low heat, bubbling very gently, until mustard seeds are plump, about 15 minutes. Let cool until room temperature, then refrigerate until chilled. (Makes ½ cup; see Tip.)
Step 3
As the stock continues to simmer, make the anchovy-garlic paste: Finely chop the anchovies and capers, occasionally smashing and spreading them using the flat side of your knife, until they start to form a paste. In a small bowl, stir together the anchovies and capers with the garlic, red-pepper flakes and olive oil until combined. (Makes ¼ cup.) Refrigerate until serving.
Step 4
Continue preparing the braised celery and scallions: Once the carrot stock has been cooked and strained, squeeze the lemon quarters over the carrot stock, then plop the squeezed pieces into the stock. Add the thyme, garlic, black peppercorns, bay leaves and salt. Bring to a simmer over medium.
Step 5
Once it simmers, cook the celery: Add the celery in two batches, one layer at time, simmering until tender, about 10 minutes per batch. (Cooked celery should bend a little, when lifted with tongs, without going totally limp.) Using tongs, transfer celery to a wide, shallow dish that can hold the celery, scallions and braising liquid.
Step 6
Cook the scallions in the stock: Add the firmer scallion whites and cook 2 minutes, then add the more tender scallion greens, and cook another 2 minutes, until all scallion pieces are tender. Add scallions to the cooked celery. Strain the stock over the scallions and celery, discarding the solids, and let the mixture cool at room temperature, about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour or, ideally, overnight. (The braised vegetables will continue to absorb flavor but retain texture; they’ll keep, refrigerated, up to one week.)
Step 7
To serve, strain the braised vegetables. (Reserve the liquid to use as a stock; poach fish in it, add to soups, stews or pasta, or dip bread in it.) Slice the celery and scallions on a sharp angle into 1½-inch-long segments, then add them to a very large bowl. Add the spigarello, Parmesan, parsley and reserved celery leaves, plus the anchovy paste and the sherry vinegar mixed with olive oil; toss to coat. The salad should have the right balance of salt, acid and heat, with no ingredient overshadowing the other. Season with extra vinegar or olive oil, if needed.
Step 8
Plate the salad, mounding in the center of the plate. Dot with 2 to 3 very small spoonfuls of mustard seeds, to taste, and serve immediately.
Use the mustard seeds to taste, but any remaining will “keep indefinitely — like mustard itself,” Ms. Stashko said. Refrigerate them for weeks or even months. Dollop the seeds on salads, roasted vegetables or any number of grilled meats for an instant burst of flavor.

In a large skillet over medium, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Without splitting them in half completely, gently flatten the hot dog buns and place them seam-side up in the pan. Move them around to catch all the melted butter and cook until very lightly toasted at the edges, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove the buns and set aside.
Step 2
Raise the heat to medium-high and add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter to the pan. When the butter is melted, add the hot dogs and cook, rolling occasionally until all sides are browned and looking crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. (See Tip if grilling.)
Step 3
Place the cooked dogs in the buns and top each with as much yellow mustard, relish and onion as you like. On one side of each dog, place a couple of tomato slices; on the other side, place a single pickle spear. Top with as many sport peppers as you can handle. Generously season with the celery salt and serve immediately.
If you’re grilling, just cook the hot dogs over direct medium heat until charred and blistered in spots, 8 to 10 minutes, and meanwhile toast the buns over the open flame as well, about 30 seconds.

cups/473 milliliters cold heavy whipping cream

Fresh red cherries, for garnish (optional)","403 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling","Step 1
Prepare the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8-inch square baking pan with olive oil.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder and baking powder until evenly distributed and no lumps remain. To a separate large bowl, add the ½ cup oil, eggs, milk, almond extract and salt and whisk until smooth, at least 30 seconds. Gently whisk the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until the last streak of flour disappears.
Step 3
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and tap gently against the counter to pop excess air bubbles. Bake until a skewer or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan.
Step 4
Microwave the cherry preserves in a small bowl in 30-second intervals or in a small saucepan over medium heat until looser and slightly liquidy. Spread the preserves evenly over the cooled cake.
Step 5
Make the frosting: In a large bowl, combine the sugar, cocoa powder and salt and pour over the hot water. Either by hand or with an electric mixer, whisk until smooth. Add the heavy cream and continue whisking until billowy soft peaks form. When you turn the whisk upside-down, a peak of cream should flop over slightly like a Santa hat. Spread the frosting over the cake and, if using, garnish with the cherries. Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Look for a brand of cherry preserves with minimal ingredients: It should consist of only cherries, sugar, pectin and some kind of citrus. That will taste more tart and less artificial than one with, say, high-fructose corn syrup and other fruit juices that muddy the natural cherry flavor.

In a large Dutch oven or pot with a lid, heat the oil and ginger slices over medium-high until the oil around the ginger starts to sizzle, 1 to 2 minutes. Season the chicken with salt, then push the ginger to the side. Add the chicken to the pan and let cook, undisturbed, until the chicken starts to brown and easily releases from the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. (It’s OK if the pieces of chicken don’t all have color, as it will be crowded.) Stir in the garlic and rice, flipping over the chicken, and cook until the rice is coated with oil and starts to sizzle, about 1 minute.

Add the stock or water, then raise the heat to high to bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up anything on the bottom of the pot. Cover and immediately lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until most of the water has been absorbed and the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. During the last 8 minutes, stir to make sure nothing is sticking on the bottom, then layer the greens on top, cover and finish cooking.

Remove from the heat, stir in the soy sauce and juice of 1 lime. Fluff the rice and let sit for 5 minutes, covered. Serve as is, or pull the chicken apart into bite-size pieces.

medium or 1 large yellow or white onion, sliced as thinly as possible, and on a mandoline for best results (8 to 10 ounces of sliced onion)
4
slices American cheese
4
soft, sturdy hamburger buns, such as King’s Hawaiian rolls

Dill pickle chips and condiments, as desired","1175 user ratings","15 to 30 minutes","Step 1
Divide the beef: Line a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Divide the ground beef into 4 even balls. Working one ball at a time and using your hands, massage the meat until it is cohesive and tacky, about 15 seconds. Next, using clean hands, roll each into a smooth ball. Place the balls on the baking sheet, with 1 ball in the center of each quadrant. Refrigerate until ready to cook.
Step 2
Shape the patties: Gently press each ball into a disk-shaped patty about 3 inches wide. Place the patties on a sheet pan or large plate, and season the tops with salt and pepper. Flip the patties, and top each with a large pile of sliced onions — as many as you can balance on top; they should resemble a large haystack. (It is important to not add salt to the onions at this point, as it will draw out excess moisture, which will inhibit searing.)
Step 3
Heat the skillet or griddle: Heat a large (12-inch) cast-iron or carbon-steel skillet or griddle (see Tips) over an indoor burner set to high heat or on the grates of a hot outdoor grill for a few minutes until very hot; a drop of water should skitter around the surface. (If you don’t have a pan skillet or griddle big enough, you can cook the burgers in batches.) Place 1 patty of beef in the center of one quadrant of the pan, with the onions on top (do not add any oil).
Step 4
Smash the burgers: Using a very stiff spatula, press on the onions and beef to form a patty 4½- to 5-inches wide. As you smash, focus on the patty’s edges so that the finished patty is slightly thicker in the center and smashed out as thinly as possible along the edges. Repeat with the remaining patties. Use the spatula to place any stray onions back on top of the burgers. Season the onions lightly with salt and pepper.
Step 5
Cook the burgers: Allow patties to cook without moving until the edges are dark brown and crusty, 1 to 2 minutes. Holding the spatula upside down (so that the head of the spatula is angled down to increase leverage), scrape the edges of each patty off the pan, working around each patty to ensure that you don’t leave any crispy edges behind. When the edges have all been loosened, turn the spatula back over (so you are holding it the standard way) and flip the patties onion side down. Use the spatula and tongs or a fork to tuck any stray onion slices mostly under the patties.
Step 6
Steam the cheese and buns: Add a slice of cheese to each patty. Place the top half of each burger bun on top of the cheese, and place the bottom half of each bun on top of the top bun, split-side down. Cover the pan or griddle with a large domed lid, a large overturned saucepan or a clean folded dish towel. (To avoid a fire, make sure the edges of the dish towel do not hang over the skillet or griddle. If cooking on an outdoor grill, just close the lid.) Continue cooking until the onions are browned along the edges and the buns are steamed through, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
Step 7
To serve, open the cover or lid. Remove the bottom burger bun halves to a serving platter. Add pickles and condiments as desired. (These burgers don’t typically need condiments.) Lift each burger from the skillet with the spatula and transfer to the bottom bun. Serve immediately.
To add some chargrilled flavor, heat your entire gas or charcoal grill to high heat. (A full chimney of coals spread out under the cooking surface for a standard kettle grill, or all the burners on high for a gas grill.) Next, smash the onion-topped patties on top of a parchment-lined sheet tray in Step 2.
When ready to cook, heat a skillet or griddle directly over one side of the grill until very hot (5 minutes with the lid off, if cooking with coal, or 15 minutes with the lid on, if cooking with gas). When the skillet is hot, brush both the grates over the empty half of the grill and the skillet or griddle with a little neutral cooking oil. Add the onion-topped patties to the grates with a spatula, season with salt and pepper, and let them cook without moving until well charred on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. When ready to flip, flip them straight into the skillet, onion-side down, and continue cooking exactly as directed in Step 6.

¼
cup tahini (or Chinese/Japanese sesame paste)
2
garlic cloves, peeled and finely grated or chopped
1
(1-inch) piece of ginger, peeled and finely grated or chopped (about 1 tablespoon)

For the Noodles
1
large eggplant (about 1¼ pounds), trimmed

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
12
ounces dried thin wheat noodles (see Tip)

Neutral oil, such as canola or vegetable
1
tablespoon soy sauce

Black pepper
½
teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorns (optional)
2
scallions, white and green parts separated and finely sliced

A generous pinch of granulated sugar

Handful of cilantro leaves
1
cup dry, unsalted roasted peanuts, roughly chopped

Chile oil or chile crisp, for serving","619 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Make the sauce: Combine the soy sauce, black or rice vinegar, tahini, garlic, ginger, chile oil and granulated sugar in a bowl, and whisk to combine. Set aside.
Step 2
Slice the eggplant crosswise into ¾-inch-thick circles, then cut each circle into 1½- to 2-inch pieces. (They should be quite chunky.)
Step 3
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add the noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve ½ cup of the cooking water, then drain the noodles, rinse just for a few seconds to remove some of the starchy water (they should still be hot), and allow them to drain.
Step 4
Meanwhile, cook the eggplant: Heat a wok or large, deep-sided skillet over medium-high. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil along with the eggplant, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper, and toss well to combine. Cover with a lid and cook for 6 to 7 minutes, tossing every 60 seconds. If it starts to burn, reduce the heat to medium. The eggplant is ready when it is caramelized and cooked all the way through but still intact. (Don’t let it get mushy.) Remove the lid, sprinkle with the ground Sichuan peppercorns (if using), the white parts of the scallions and the sugar, and season with ½ teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper. Toss for 30 seconds and then turn off the heat.
Step 5
Add the reserved noodle cooking water to the bowl of sauce and whisk to combine. Divide the sauce among four serving bowls.
Step 6
Divide the noodles among the four bowls, on top of the sauce. Finish each bowl with eggplant, scallion greens, a few cilantro leaves and some peanuts.
Step 7
To eat, toss everything together so that the noodles and eggplant are well coated in the sauce. Serve topped with chile oil or crisp.
You can also use egg noodles, but the dish will no longer be vegan.

Heat the broiler to high and set a rack in the upper third in the oven. In a medium bowl, stir to combine 2 tablespoons oil with the turmeric and red-pepper flakes. Season the salmon all over with 1 teaspoon salt, then toss to coat in the spiced oil.
Step 2

Broil until the green beans are blistered and charred in spots, and the salmon’s skin is crisp and the flesh is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 10 minutes. Halfway through broiling, check the vegetables; if any are burning, give them a stir so they’re no longer in direct contact with the broiler.

Meanwhile, in a large bowl, stir together the remaining corn kernels, the red onion, lime juice and 1 teaspoon salt.
Step 5
Transfer the salmon to a platter or plates, then scrape the charred vegetables into the bowl of raw corn and onion. Stir to combine and season to taste with salt. Spoon the vegetables alongside the salmon and drizzle everything with a little olive oil.

1
long red pepper (such as Fresno) or long green pepper (such as jalapeño or serrano), thinly sliced

Cooked rice, to serve","498 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
To make the seasoning, combine the salt, sugar, white pepper, five-spice powder and ground ginger in a small bowl, and stir to combine. Set aside.
Step 2
Place the drained tofu onto a clean kitchen towel and pat dry. Cut the tofu into ¾-inch cubes.
Step 3
Scatter ¼ cup of the cornstarch onto a large plate or sheet pan. Carefully place the tofu cubes onto the cornstarch, then scatter the remaining cornstarch on top of the tofu. Using clean hands, gently dab each side of the tofu into the cornstarch until it is coated on all sides.
Step 4
Line a large plate with a paper towel or a clean kitchen towel.
Step 5
Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick or well seasoned cast-iron skillet on medium-high. Add 3 tablespoons of neutral oil and heat until the oil shimmers. Making sure the tofu pieces are not touching each other (you may need to work in batches), add the coated tofu to the skillet and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side until the tofu is golden and crispy. Remove and place on the paper or kitchen towel to absorb excess oil. Continue with remaining tofu, adding more oil as needed.
Step 6
The empty skillet should still have a small amount of oil, but if it doesn’t, add 1 tablespoon more of oil. With the skillet over medium heat, add the scallions and pepper and stir-fry for 30 to 60 seconds until softened and fragrant. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on the same paper or kitchen towel.
Step 7
Transfer the tofu to a plate and sprinkle with about half of the salt and pepper seasoning. Top with scallions and pepper. Serve with rice and the remaining salt and pepper seasoning.
This seasoning is great to have on hand for several applications; along with tofu, it can be served on top of battered vegetables such as eggplant or cauliflower, or over roasted vegetables or salads. Make extra and store in a jar with a tight lid.

tablespoon olive oil

Fine sea salt and black pepper
¼
cup fresh cilantro leaves and soft stems
1
small ball buffalo mozzarella (about 4½ ounces/125 grams), roughly torn","369 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Start with the dressing: Add the tomatoes, oil, garlic, miso, bay leaves, cardamom shells and seeds, paprika and a heaping ¼ teaspoon salt to a large (lidded) sauté pan. Place over medium-high heat, give everything a good stir and leave it, uncovered, until it starts to bubble gently.
Step 2
Once bubbling, turn the heat down to medium-low, cover with the lid and cook gently for 15 minutes, stirring once, until the tomatoes have burst and start to release their juices. Turn down the heat if necessary; you want the garlic to soften without taking on color, and you want the tomatoes to not completely disintegrate. Stir in the lime juice and set aside.
Step 3
Heat a grill pan over high, and ventilate your kitchen well.
Step 4
Halve the cucumbers lengthwise then use a small spoon to scrape out and discard the seeds. Slice each halved cucumber lengthwise into 2 equal pieces, then transfer the cucumber quarters to a bowl and toss with the oil, ½ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. When the grill pan is very hot, grill them in batches, cut sides down, for 2 to 3 minutes, then flip them over and grill for 1 to 2 minutes more. You want nice grill marks and for the cucumbers to soften but still retain a bite. (You don’t want any floppy cucumbers.) As they’re ready, immediately transfer to the tomato pan, stirring to coat in the dressing.
Step 5
Once they’re all grilled, stir the cilantro into the pan and transfer the mixture to a large serving platter with a lip. Sprinkle on the torn mozzarella, along with a good pinch of salt, and tuck the cheese under the cucumbers in places. You can serve this dish hot or at room temperature.

(¼-inch-thick) slices from a large ripe tomato
½
cup grated fresh or low-moisture mozzarella
4

Arugula, for serving","387 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Lightly grease a large plate with oil and set aside. In a medium bowl, combine the ground chicken with ½ cup Parmesan, the basil, tomato paste, garlic and 1 teaspoon salt. Working the meat as little as possible, form 4 patties that are each about 4½ inches wide and about ½ cup or 135 grams. Transfer to the greased plate and refrigerate until Step 3. (This helps prevent the juices and fat from leaking.)
Step 2
On a rimmed plate, sprinkle the tomato slices with salt. In a bowl, stir together the mozzarella and the remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan.
Step 3
Heat ½ teaspoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Add the buns, cut sides down, and toast until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to serving plates.
Step 4
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the skillet over medium. Working in batches if necessary, add the patties and cook until browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. (Reduce heat if the patties are burning.) Flip the patties, top with the cheese mixture, cover the skillet with a lid or baking sheet, and cook until the cheese is melted and the patties are cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn off the heat.
Step 5
Pat the tomatoes dry. To each bottom bun, add a handful of arugula, followed by a slice of tomato, a chicken patty and its top bun. Serve hot.

Prepare the bread crumbs: Add all of the anchovy oil from the tin (about 2 tablespoons) to a large skillet. Transfer the anchovies from their tin to a cutting board, draining them well. Finely chop 2 anchovies and add to the skillet, then turn the heat to medium-high. Cook the anchovies, stirring occasionally, until they start to sizzle, about 1 minute. Stir in the bread crumbs and cook, stirring constantly, until golden and toasted, 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.
Step 2
Make the dressing: Set aside 4 anchovies (for garnish later) and finely chop the rest (there should be about 6). Add the chopped anchovies to a large bowl, along with the garlic, olive oil, mayonnaise, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and Parmesan. Season generously with pepper and whisk to combine.
Step 3
Dress the salad: Add the radicchio leaves to the dressing and toss. The salad should be lightly dressed, not thickly caked. Taste for acidity, adjusting with more lemon juice if your radicchio is especially bitter. Transfer to a large plate, piling the leaves high. Top with a final grating of Parmesan and the bread crumbs, and garnish with the remaining anchovies. Serve immediately.

Extra-virgin olive oil
¼
cup salt-packed or brined capers, rinsed
1½ to 2
pounds eggplant (about 2 medium or large), trimmed and sliced into ½-inch disks
1
large handful of parsley, basil or a combination, finely chopped, plus more to serve
2
garlic cloves, grated
1
teaspoon red-pepper flakes

Zest and juice of 1 lemon

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
2
balls burrata (about 1 pound), at room temperature","529 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
In a small saucepan or skillet, heat ¼ cup olive oil over medium-high until it shimmers, about 1 minute. Meanwhile, dry the capers very well by wrapping them in paper towels or a clean dish towel and wringing out the moisture. (If there is too much moisture, the oil will sputter aggressively.) Line a plate or tray with paper towels or a clean dish towel.
Step 2
When the oil is ready, carefully drop the capers in and fry for 2 to 3 minutes, until golden. (Watch closely, as smaller capers will cook more quickly.) Remove the capers from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on the lined plate. They will crisp up further as they cool.
Step 3
Transfer the caper-infused oil to a large heatproof bowl and set aside to cool for a few minutes.
Step 4
Lay the disks of eggplant on a large cutting board or sheet pan and drizzle with olive oil, flip over and drizzle the other side. Heat a large (12-inch) grill pan or cast-iron skillet on medium-high. (See Tip for grilling instructions.) When hot, working in batches, add the eggplant disks in a single layer and cook for 2 minutes, pressing the eggplant into the pan to encourage browning. Flip, reduce heat to medium and cook on the other side for another 2 to 3 minutes, until completely tender. (The eggplant continues to soften as it soaks up the marinade in the next step, so don’t be tempted to overcook.) Remove the eggplant from the pan and place them back on the cutting board or plate. Continue cooking the remaining eggplant.
Step 5
Meanwhile, to the bowl with the cooled caper-infused oil, add the herbs, garlic, red-pepper flakes, lemon zest and juice, ½ teaspoon of kosher salt and a few pinches of black pepper. Toss to combine and taste, making sure it has enough salt. Add the warm eggplant slices to the oil and gently toss to coat. Allow to marinate for at least 5 minutes (see Tip).
Step 6
Serve this on one large platter or as four separate servings. Place the burrata (for single servings, halve each ball of burrata) on the plate along with the eggplant and top with any remaining marinade and the fried capers, and scatter with fresh herbs.
To grill the eggplant: Heat a grill to medium-high, and clean and oil the grates. Grill the eggplant over direct heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until there are char marks and the eggplant has begun to soften. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until cooked through. If using a gas grill, close the lid between flips.
The cooked eggplant can be prepared up to 24 hours ahead and left to marinate in the fridge, which will intensify the flavors; bring it to room temperature before serving.

White or brown rice, for serving (optional)
2

Toasted sesame seeds, for serving","386 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
Using a sharp knife (a small paring knife works best), score the zucchini flesh in a crisscross pattern, taking care not to slice all the way through.
Step 2
Make the glaze: In a small bowl, combine the miso paste, mirin, granulated sugar and soy sauce. Add 1 tablespoon of water and whisk until combined.
Step 3
Liberally brush the cut sides of the zucchini with the glaze. Drizzle each piece with a little oil.
Step 4
Heat a large grill pan (or a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet) over medium-high. When hot, working in batches, place the zucchini, glazed side down, onto the hot surface. Press the zucchini onto the surface to encourage charring. (If you’re using a regular skillet, you may need to add more oil to the pan.) Cook without moving for 2 to 4 minutes until golden and charred.
Step 5
Flip the zucchini over onto the skin side, reduce heat to medium, cover with a lid and cook for 4 to 5 minutes until tender. To check for doneness, give the sides of the zucchini a squeeze; if it yields easily, it is ready.
Step 6
Remove the zucchini from the pan and brush more glaze over the cut side. Serve on its own or on top of rice, if desired, and scatter with scallions and sesame seeds.
To grill the zucchini: Heat a grill to medium-high, and clean and oil the grates. Grill the glazed zucchini over direct heat, flesh side down, for 2 to 3 minutes, until there are char marks and the zucchini has begun to soften and turn golden. Flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until cooked through. If using a gas grill, close the lid between flips.

teaspoons salt (any type), plus more to taste
1½
cups/340 grams fine or medium yellow cornmeal, plus more if needed
2
cups vegetable oil, plus more as needed","96 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Wash the okra, and place aside, leaving the okra slightly wet. Cut the okra crosswise into ½-inch pieces and place in a large bowl. Season the okra with the salt, adding more to taste.
Step 2
Pour the cornmeal over the okra. Using both hands, firmly grip the bowl, and shake it until all the okra pieces are coated. If too dry, add a little water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and, if needed, more cornmeal can be added. Lightly press the okra with your hands, making sure that the cornmeal sticks to the okra. Toss the okra again. All the pieces should be coated evenly, with a light layer of cornmeal — but the okra shouldn't be obscured.
Step 3
In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. You can determine if the oil is ready by dropping a pinch of cornmeal into it; the oil should sizzle, but not smoke. (If it’s not hot enough, the okra will soak up the oil.)
Step 4
Once the oil is ready, working in two batches to avoid crowding, drop half the okra into the hot oil and cook it, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, until golden and crisp. Using a slotted spoon or spider, remove the okra to a plate covered with a paper towel to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining okra, and serve immediately.

Make the rémoulade: In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, Cajun seasoning, vinegar and lemon juice. (Makes about 1½ cups rémoulade.) Cover the sauce and chill it in the fridge until you serve.
Step 2
Prepare the okra: Pour oil into a large pot with high sides and a lid, to a depth of a few inches. Heat oil over medium-high to 350 degrees.

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Combine chicken and onion on a rimmed sheet pan. Toss with 1½ teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Add tarragon and 1½ tablespoons oil, and toss to combine. Let stand at room temperature while preparing other ingredients.
Step 2
In a small saucepan, combine vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar, bay leaf and remaining 1 teaspoon salt over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring frequently to dissolve sugar.
Step 3
Place sliced cucumbers in medium bowl. Add 2 tablespoons of the vinegar solution to cucumbers and toss. Set aside.
Step 4
Return pan to medium-low heat and add another tablespoon sugar. Once sugar dissolves, stir in cherries. Cook until cherries are slightly broken down, 3 to 4 minutes. Taste and add more sugar if the cherries still seem very tart. (You’re not looking for them to be sweet, just balanced.)
Step 5
Spoon cherries and their juices around chicken and onions. (It’s OK if some cherries are on top of chicken and onions.) Roast until chicken is cooked through and cherries and onions are lightly browned in spots, 30 to 35 minutes. Give the dish a big stir and spoon the savory pan juices all over the top of the chicken.
Step 6
While the chicken is roasting, stir yogurt and remaining 1 tablespoon oil into the bowl with the pickled cucumbers. Season with a large pinch of salt and black pepper. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Just before serving, stir well, taste and add more salt if needed.

(Keep watch: This happens quickly.) Turn off the heat, then add the marshmallows (the pan may still be hot), and stir vigorously until melted. Working quickly, add the cereal and salt and stir to combine. Add the chocolate and stir to combine.
Step 3
Immediately scrape the mixture into the prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer. Broil until the top is golden and charred in spots, about 1 minute, watching closely. Let cool completely, then cut into squares or bars. Store, covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days.

"Loaded Vegan Nachos","American,Cauliflower,Chipotles In Adobo,Nacho,Nutritional Yeast,Pickled Jalapeno Pepper,Snack,Appetizer,Main Course,Vegan,Vegetarian","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","2
pounds cauliflower (about 1 medium head), florets and stem coarsely chopped
1
medium white or red onion, finely chopped
2
tablespoons neutral oil (such as canola or grapeseed)

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
½
cup nutritional yeast
1
(15-ounce) can pinto beans, drained, bean liquid reserved
½ to 1
chipotle chile in adobo (depending on heat preference), plus 2 teaspoons sauce
1½
teaspoons garlic powder
½
cup sliced pickled jalapeños, plus brine
1
(12-ounce) bag of sturdy tortilla chips
1
lime
¼
cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and stems, plus small sprigs for topping

Optional toppings: pico de gallo or chopped tomato, avocado or guacamole, vegan crema, sliced radishes, black olives","187 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. On a sheet pan, toss together half the cauliflower, half the onion and the oil. Season with salt, then spread into an even layer. Roast on the bottom rack, without stirring, until brown underneath, 20 to 25 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the vegan queso: In a medium saucepan, combine 1 ½ cups water with the remaining cauliflower, the nutritional yeast, bean liquid, chipotle chile, garlic powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium-high and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the cauliflower is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a blender, and blend until smooth, then add 2 teaspoons of pickled jalapeño brine and blend to combine. Taste the queso on a chip; if flavors are muted, add more salt and brine. (Hold onto the saucepan; no need to clean.)
Step 3
In a medium bowl, add the adobo sauce to the beans and mash some of the beans with a fork. (This helps the beans adhere to the chip.) When the roasted cauliflower is done, zest the lime over, add the chopped cilantro and stir to combine. Scrape into the reserved saucepan. (Hold onto the sheet pan and don’t worry about getting every last bit off.)
Step 4
Assemble: On the sheet pan, spread half the chips into an even layer. Top with half the beans, half the cauliflower and half the queso. Repeat another layer with the remaining chips, queso, beans and cauliflower. Bake until the chips and beans are warm, 3 to 5 minutes. Cut the lime into wedges. Top nachos with the pickled jalapeños, remaining chopped onion, cilantro sprigs, a squeeze of lime and any optional toppings.

cup/66 grams shredded sharp Cheddar
6
tablespoons/85 grams cold unsalted butter, plus more for baking sheet
1
cup/240 milliliters cold buttermilk","357 user ratings","55 minutes, plus chilling","Step 1
Stir-fry the chopped kimchi in a stainless-steel pan over medium heat until the juices have evaporated and the kimchi smells even more fragrant, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a plate and allow to cool completely.
Step 2
Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and brown sugar in a bowl, breaking up any lumps of sugar. Add the cheese and the cooled kimchi. Stir to combine; it’s all right if the dough is scraggly.
Step 3
On the large holes of a grater, grate the chilled butter over the other ingredients and stir to combine. You want the butter to be around the size of peas. While stirring, gradually add the buttermilk and stir until combined. Be careful to handle the dough as little as possible.
Step 4
Drop the dough in 6 mounds onto a greased baking sheet. (If your baking sheet is nonstick, line it with parchment paper instead.) Pat the mounds gently into squares.
Step 5
Put the biscuits on their baking sheet in a freezer to chill for at least 1 hour. Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
Step 6
Bake the biscuits until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Remove the biscuits from the oven, and allow them to sit for several minutes before serving hot.
For more delicate biscuits, use 1⅔ cups/214 grams all-purpose flour and ⅓ cup/42 grams pastry flour.

Reduce the heat to medium. Carefully pour in the reserved marinade and boil, scraping up browned bits, until slightly thickened, about 2 minutes. Pour the sauce over the chicken and turn to coat. Eat the chicken drizzled with sauce.
To grill, heat a grill to medium-high. Oil the grates. Wipe off excess marinade from the chicken, then grill over direct heat until the chicken is well browned on one side and easily releases from the grates, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, 2 to 5 minutes. (For a gas grill, close the lid between flips.) Set on a plate or platter to rest.

Cut tofu across into ¾-inch-thick slices, then cut each slice in half so you have roughly 12 squares.

If using dried apricots, at least 40 minutes before cooking, cut them into quarters, soak in warm water to cover, then drain and set aside. (This can be done up to a day ahead. Cover and refrigerate, then bring to room temperature before using.)
Step 2
Warm the oil in a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the onion, season with ½ teaspoon of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion begins to turn golden at the edges, about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.

teaspoons mild chile flakes, such as gochugaru (see Tip)

Salt
6
ears corn, shucked

Small handful of minced fresh parsley leaves or chives","462 user ratings","20 minutes, plus time for heating grill","Step 1
Combine the honey, butter, chile flakes, 1 cup water and 1 teaspoon of salt in a deep disposable 9-by-13-inch aluminum tray.
Step 2
Adjust the burners on a gas grill or arrange the hot coals on a charcoal grill to build a fire that is hot on one side and medium-low on the other side. Place the aluminum tray on the cooler side. Cover and let heat for a few minutes, swirling the butter occasionally until it is all melted and the liquid simmers gently.
Step 3
Add the corn to the hot side of the grill and cook, turning occasionally, until the kernels are lightly blackened in spots all over, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 4
Transfer the corn to the aluminum tray and turn to coat in the liquid. Keep turning as the liquid reduces to a shiny glaze, 10 to 12 minutes. (You can also cook other foods over the hot side while the corn stays hot in the tray. Once glazed, you can continue to hold the corn in the pan for up to another 30 to 45 minutes, turning it occasionally and topping up with ¼ cup water as necessary to prevent the honey and butter from burning.)
Step 5
When ready to serve, coat a final time, sprinkle the corn with the minced parsley or chives and transfer to a serving platter.
You can use whatever chile flakes you like, or omit them altogether if you prefer. Korean gochugaru gives the corn a mild heat and nice smoky, roasted aroma, but ancho chile powder is also fantastic here.

cup/120 grams heavy cream, plus more if needed and for serving if you’d like
12
ounces/340 grams bittersweet chocolate, coarsely broken or chopped (see Tip)
8
large egg whites (265 grams/1 cup)
¼
cup/50 grams granulated sugar
4
large egg yolks (56 grams)
1
teaspoon pure vanilla extract","585 user ratings","20 minutes, plus overnight chilling","Step 1
Bring an inch of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Combine the cream and chocolate in a large heatproof bowl. When the water boils, turn the heat to low so the water is barely simmering or just steaming. Set the bowl over the saucepan and melt the chocolate, gently stirring with a whisk now and then.
Step 2
While the chocolate melts, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl using a stand mixer or electric hand mixer on medium speed. When the whites are foamy, add the sugar in a slow stream while whisking. Continue whisking until stiff peaks form. The whites should look glossy but not dry, and, when you lift the whisk from the mixture, a peak should form in the bowl and hold.
Step 3
Once the chocolate has melted completely, turn off the heat but leave the bowl over the saucepan. Holding the bowl with a kitchen towel, add the egg yolks one at a time, whisking after each addition. If the mixture looks broken, remove the bowl from the saucepan, cool for a minute, then add 1 tablespoon cream and whisk just until shiny and smooth. Whisk in the vanilla. (Don’t worry if it still doesn’t look completely smooth. It will come together in the next step.)
Step 4
Add a quarter of the beaten whites to the chocolate mixture and stir gently with a flexible rubber spatula until incorporated but still a little streaky. This will make it easier to fold in the remaining whites to create an airy mousse by gradually lowering the temperature of the chocolate (tempering) and making the mixture loose.
Step 5
Add the rest of the whites and fold them in by running the spatula from 12 o’clock on the bowl to 6 o’clock, then scooping up the chocolate on the bottom and gently folding it over the whites as you move toward 9 o’clock. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat. Continue folding just until the last streak of white disappears. It’s OK if there are a few lumps of whites left. It’s better to not deflate the batter by folding too much.
Step 6
Scoop into a pretty bowl or into individual cups or bowls for serving if you’d like. Otherwise, keep it in the mixing bowl. Refrigerate the mousse uncovered until cool, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 more hours and preferably 24. The covered mousse can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.
Step 7
If you’d like to serve the mousse with whipped cream, whisk heavy cream until soft peaks form. A cup or two of heavy cream is plenty for this amount of mousse. Serve the mousse cold, straight from the refrigerator, with the whipped cream.
Use chocolate meant for eating or for making confections, not baking chocolate, which has a higher proportion of cacao solids and results in a dense and possibly gritty mousse. Chocolate with 70 percent to 74 percent cacao is ideal, but choose your favorite. This will taste best with whichever bar of chocolate you enjoy eating on its own.

In a large bowl, combine the gochugaru, vinegar, sesame oil, 1 teaspoon of the garlic, 1 teaspoon of the ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, the fish sauce and ½ teaspoon of the sugar; mix well. Add bok choy and scallions, and toss with your hands, working the sauce in between and all over the leaves.
Step 2
Heat a grill to medium-high or heat a stovetop griddle pan over medium-high. In a large bowl, combine the gochujang, neutral oil, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon black pepper and the remaining 2 teaspoons garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1 tablespoon sugar; mix well. Very lightly season the pork with salt and pepper. Add pork and onion to the marinade and toss, gently massaging the marinade all over the meat (The meat does not need to rest in the marinade before it is grilled, but it can be marinated for up to 3 hours.)
Step 3
Grill the pork and onion, in batches if necessary, until nicely charred and caramelized around the edges, and the pork is cooked through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a serving platter.
Step 4
Serve the grilled pork and onions with the fresh sesame kimchi and rice on the side.
You don’t need to be precious about how you slice the meat. The pieces themselves do not need to be the same size, just the same thickness. Slice crosswise as best as possible, then rely on pounding to even everything out.

cups mayonnaise
1
teaspoon garlic salt
½
teaspoon sugar
½
teaspoon black pepper, freshly cracked
½
teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Hot sauce, such as Tabasco, to taste","561 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
If using taro, put on kitchen gloves and wash the taro. Bring 1 to 2 inches of water to a boil in a pot with a steamer insert, then put the taro in the insert and cover tightly with a lid. Steam until tender, about 3 hours. Transfer to a plate and let cool. Use a paring knife to remove the skin, then cut into 1-inch cubes.
Step 2
Fill a large saucepan with water and add a generous pinch of salt, so the water tastes like the ocean. Scrub the potatoes, then add to the saucepan — there should be just enough water to cover — and bring up to a simmer over medium-high heat. (Don’t go for a roiling boil because you want to keep the potatoes intact.) Simmer until a paring knife inserted in the center goes in and out smoothly, 20 to 40 minutes. The potatoes should look barely translucent and have small cracks and a slightly crumbly texture on the surface. Drain carefully and turn out onto a sheet pan. When cool, peel and cut into 1-inch cubes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the eggs and cook for 10 minutes. Drain and immediately transfer to a bowl of ice and water. Replenish the boiling water, if needed, and add the macaroni. Cook until softened all the way through, at least 2 minutes past al dente. Drain well and immediately run under cold water to stop the cooking.
Step 4
When the noodles are cool, drain well and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Peel the eggs and grate them on the large holes of a box grater. Add them to the bowl, along with the potatoes, taro (if using), carrot, mayonnaise, garlic salt, sugar, black pepper, apple cider vinegar and hot sauce. Mix well with a spoon and adjust the seasonings to taste. Eat immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 days.
The presence of microscopic needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in raw taro can make your hands itchy, so it’s a good idea to wear kitchen gloves when handling. Never take a bite of raw taro. Instead of steaming the taro, you can put it in a pressure cooker (at 5 pounds of pressure) for 90 minutes and then let the pressure release naturally.

Wet your hands and toss marinated chicken with tapioca flour and about 1 tablespoon water until the tapioca flour looks like small beads and clings to the chicken. (Adding a little moisture to your chicken helps the tapioca flour form small beads that will also stick to the chicken and give it a very crunchy crust.)
Step 4
Working in batches, add the battered chicken to the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. With a slotted spoon or spider, transfer fried chicken to a paper towel-lined plate and season each batch with peppercorn mixture.
Step 5
Fry basil leaves until translucent and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes, then scatter over the fried chicken. Serve with leftover peppercorn mixture for sprinkling to taste.

"Edna Lewis’s Peach Cobbler","Southern,Editors' Pick,Peach,Dessert","Yield: 6 to 8 servings","For the Pastry
3
cups sifted all-purpose flour (345 grams)
1½
teaspoons kosher salt
1
teaspoon granulated sugar
1
cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces and frozen for 10 minutes
2
tablespoons lard or vegetable shortening, frozen for 10 minutes and cut into small pieces
1 to 2
teaspoons granulated sugar, for sprinkling on top crust, optional
For the Filling
8
cups firm but ripe peeled, sliced peaches
¾
cup granulated sugar
2
tablespoons all-purpose flour
¼
teaspoon salt
½
teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
4
tablespoons (½ stick) butter, thinly sliced","942 user ratings","1 hour 45 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling","Step 1
Make the pastry: Set aside a small bowl of ice water. On a work surface, mound flour, salt and sugar, and mix to blend. Top with frozen butter and lard or shortening, and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to mix until it resembles coarse meal; some large pieces of the fats should still be visible.
Step 2
Quickly form a mound and, with your finger, draw a trench down the center. Sprinkle trench with 1 tablespoon ice water and fluff flour so it absorbs the water. Repeat three times, drawing trenches and sprinkling each with 1 tablespoon ice water, so 4 tablespoons of water have been incorporated. The dough should be starting to clump in large pieces. If necessary, add water by droplets until dough begins to form a mass.
Step 3
Gather dough with a pastry scraper. Working quickly, use the heel of your hand to smear an egg-size piece of dough by pushing it away from you. Continue with remaining dough (about 6 smears total), then gather dough again and repeat the process. Shape into 2 flat disks, and cover each in a double-thickness of plastic wrap, pressing wrapped disks to further shape and bind them. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.
Step 4
Roll out one chilled disk to ⅛-inch thickness, large enough to line and slightly overhang an 8-inch-square 2-inch-deep baking dish, or other shallow 2-quart pan. Trim to leave ½ inch of pastry above rim, refrigerating both pan and trimmings. Roll out remaining dough to about ⅛-inch thickness, to cover top of cobbler, again trimming and refrigerating excess dough. Slide top crust onto a plate, and refrigerate.
Step 5
Make the filling: Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a mixing bowl, toss together peaches, sugar, flour, salt and nutmeg. Place mixture in the crust-lined baking dish, and tuck chilled trimmings into the center and sides of the filling, scattering them throughout. Top with butter slices. Moisten rim of dough with water and slide flat pastry crust on top. Press edges of dough to seal, and cut a few 1-inch slits in top crust. If desired, sprinkle with sugar.
Step 6
Bake for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees, and continue to bake until crust is deep golden brown and filling begins to bubble through slits, 30 to 40 more minutes. Cool cobbler on a rack until warm. If desired, serve with lightly sweetened whipped cream or ice cream.

"Churrasco (Grilled Marinated Skirt Steak)","Meat,Steaks And Chops,Adobo Seasoning,Lime Juice,Skirt Steak,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","For the Steak
1½
pounds skirt steak or tri-tip (see Tip)
3
large garlic cloves
1
tablespoon fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped
1
tablespoon white vinegar
2
teaspoons olive oil
1
tablespoon adobo seasoning (preferably Loísa or Badía brands)
1
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste
For the Wasakaka
⅓
cup fresh lime juice
½
cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped
¼
cup fresh cilantro leaves, finely chopped
¼
cup fresh oregano leaves, finely chopped
¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil
2
garlic cloves, minced
½
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
¼
teaspoon freshly ground black pepper","543 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Pat the steaks dry and place in a large zip-top bag.
Step 2
Combine the garlic, oregano, vinegar, olive oil, adobo seasoning and salt in the bowl of a pilón or mortar and pestle, or a small food processor. Grind into a thin paste, then pour the marinade over the steak. Zip the bag then shake well to coat the meat, rubbing in gently as needed. Let rest on the counter for 10 to 20 minutes, or refrigerate overnight if you have time. Be sure to let the steak come to room temperature before grilling.
Step 3
If using a charcoal grill, start by building a fire with hardwood and kindling, then adding lump hardwood charcoal once the fire is kicking. Allow the fire to mellow. If using a gas grill, set the temperature to 500 degrees.
Step 4
Meanwhile, make the wasakaka: Combine the lime juice, parsley, cilantro, oregano, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl and whisk to incorporate. If you’d like a creamier sauce, blend in a small food processor or blender. (Wasakaka will keep for 3 or 4 days in a sealed jar in the refrigerator.)
Step 5
Once the grill is ready, remove skirt steak from the bag and shake off excess marinade. Place on the grill and sear for 1 to 3 minutes. Using tongs, pull up the corner to ensure the steak has a good dark char, bordering on burned in places, before flipping, then cook for 1 more minute for rare, 2 minutes for medium-rare. Be careful not to overcook or steak will be tough.
Step 6
Remove steak from grill and let rest for 5 to 7 minutes. Slice into strips and pour over wasakaka, or serve sauce on the side. Taste and sprinkle with additional salt, if desired.
Skirt steak and tri-tip are very different cuts, but both work well for this recipe. Because tri-tip is typically a thicker, rounder cut than skirt steak, you’ll need to flip it a few more times on the grill.

Toppings (such as butter lettuce, sliced onion, tomato and dill pickles) and condiments (mayonnaise, ketchup or mustard), for serving","230 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat a grill to medium-high and oil the grates. (The burgers can also be cooked in a lightly greased nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side.)
Step 2
In a food processor, working in 2 batches, pulse the mushrooms, scraping down the sides and bottom, until finely chopped but not puréed. (The mushrooms should be chopped so finely they almost resemble ground meat. If cut into larger pieces, they may cause the patties to fall apart on the grill.) Transfer to a large bowl and add the beef. Mix until well blended, then form into 8 equal patties, each about 4 inches wide. Pack the patties tightly and pinch any split edges together to seal. (Since the meat mixture is half mushroom, it cannot be overworked, so you don't need to worry about density.)
Step 3
Season the patties with salt and pepper, and grill, undisturbed, until lightly charred underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. (Resist the urge to prod or move the burgers during these first few minutes, as they need to cook, undisturbed, to form a crust underneath. Once they have caramelized, they'll be easy to flip, but if you attempt to do so before the patties release easily, they can fall apart.) Gently flip burgers and grill until golden and cooked to medium, 3 to 4 minutes longer, topping each with a slice of cheese during the last minute of cooking. Transfer burgers to a large platter.

Build burgers with buns, preferred toppings and condiments.

Step 3
To fry the wonton wrappers, cut the squares into ½-inch strips, then cut those strips in half crosswise to shorten them. In a medium saucepan, heat an inch of oil over medium to 350 degrees, or until a wonton strip immediately bubbles when added. Carefully add the wonton strips to the hot oil and, stirring constantly with a slotted spoon, fry until puffy and golden, 30 seconds to 2 minutes.

Wonton wrappers are uncooked, flour-based thin sheets of dough, about 3½ inches square. You can find them in the refrigerated section of supermarkets. Store-bought fried wonton wrappers, often packaged as “wonton strips,” are a convenient alternative, though they can be harder to find; look for them near the salad croutons.

Place the potatoes in a large pot with enough salted water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the kind of potato. Drain very well.
Step 2
Heat the broiler. Arrange 1 bunch scallions on a sheet pan. Thinly slice the other bunch, reserving the slices for serving.
Step 3
Season the whole scallions in the pan with salt and pepper, and very lightly drizzle with olive oil. Broil until charred, tossing occasionally, for 3 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to cool. Coarsely chop scallions and set aside.
Step 4
In a large bowl, whisk together lemon juice, garlic, cumin and a large pinch of salt. Let sit for 1 minute to mellow the garlic and dissolve the salt. Whisk in tahini, then gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (about 3 to 6 tablespoons total), until the sauce thickens and is smooth enough to drizzle. The sauce can take 30 seconds to 1 minute to thicken so keep whisking; if it gets too thick, thin it down with a little more water. Taste and add more lemon juice and salt if needed.
Step 5
Transfer hot potatoes and charred scallions to bowl with tahini dressing. Drizzle in the remaining ⅓ cup olive oil and toss until potatoes are well coated. Taste and add more salt and lemon juice if needed.

Let cool to room temperature for at least an hour before serving, or refrigerate for up to 24 hours. The potatoes will absorb the dressing as they sit. Just before serving, taste and add more salt or lemon juice if needed, and toss with the raw scallion slices and herbs.

1
(6-ounce/170-gram) container fresh raspberries
For the Glaze
1 to 2
tablespoons lemon juice (from half of one of the zested lemons from the cake)
¾
cup/75 grams sifted confectioners’ sugar

Pinch of salt","410 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch round or 8-inch square pan, then line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.
Step 2
Zest the 2 lemons into a large mixing bowl. Add ¾ cup/150 grams of sugar and the eggs, and whisk vigorously until pale and smooth, about 30 seconds.
Step 3
Add the sour cream, melted butter and salt, and mix until smooth and emulsified. Whisk in the baking powder and baking soda.
Step 4
Add the flour and cornmeal, and stir until just a few streaks of flour remain. Add ⅔ of the raspberries and fold them into the batter.
Step 5
Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and top with the remaining raspberries. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons of granulated sugar over the top.
Step 6
Bake the cake until puffed and golden brown and a skewer inserted comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes.
Step 7
Carefully run a thin knife or offset spatula around the edge of the pan, then set the pan on a wire rack and let the cake cool completely in the pan. When the cake is cool, remove it from the pan, gently peel off the parchment and set it on a serving plate.
Step 8
While the cake cools, make the glaze: Juice some of the zested lemon to produce 2 tablespoons of juice. To a medium bowl, add the confectioners’ sugar, a pinch of salt and 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice. Whisk until smooth, adding more lemon juice as necessary to make a thin but still opaque glaze.
Step 9
Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake and let it set for a few minutes before serving. Store any leftovers at room temperature, loosely covered for up to 2 days.

¼
cup shredded cheese (Cheddar, Monterey Jack or a blend)","161 user ratings","10 minutes","Step 1
Crack the eggs into a bowl and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper. Beat with a fork until evenly yellow. Leave the bowl next to the stove while you make the toast.

In a small nonstick skillet, melt a thin slice of the butter over medium-low heat. Swipe the bread in the melted butter to soak it all up. Let sit until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add another thin slice of butter to the pan then flip the bread, swiping it in the newly melted butter until it’s all soaked up. Turn the heat to the lowest setting and let the bread sit until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

cups vegetables (any combination of broccoli, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, brussels sprouts, mushrooms), cut into 1-inch pieces (see Tip)
2
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving

fresh thyme sprigs or 1 teaspoon dried thyme (optional)
For the (optional) Garlicky Yogurt Sauce
1
cup whole-milk Greek yogurt
1 to 2
garlic cloves, finely grated or minced
1
tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Pinch each salt and freshly ground black pepper","333 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the vegetables: Heat oven to 425 degrees. Add the vegetables to a rimmed sheet pan. Add 2 tablespoons oil, the salt, pepper and thyme (if using), and gently toss vegetables to coat. Use your hands to spread the vegetables out into one layer, spacing them evenly all over the pan.
Step 2
Transfer to the oven and roast until they are tender and browned, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring at least once during roasting for even cooking.
Step 3
While vegetables roast, you can make yogurt sauce if you like: In a small bowl, combine yogurt, garlic, oil, salt and pepper. Taste and adjust seasoning. Cover and place in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Step 4
Serve roasted vegetables with a dollop of garlic yogurt, if desired, and a drizzle of oil on top.
If you’d like to swap these vegetables for denser vegetables, use any combination of carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips, butternut squash and cauliflower, cut into 1-inch chunks. Add an extra tablespoon of oil and extra ½ teaspoon of salt. Roast for 40 to 50 minutes. These vegetables take longer to cook and absorb more oil while roasting.

Set a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and swirl it around the pan until it melts. The soaked bread will be really soft, so carefully pick up each slice by sliding your whole hand under it, then setting it in the pan. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the slices, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the other sides are brown, 2 to 3 minutes.

1
(14- to 16-ounce) container firm tofu
1
(13.5-ounce) can coconut milk
1
medium onion, chopped

Salt and pepper
1
tablespoon curry powder, plus more to taste

Cooked rice or other grains or noodles, for serving

Hot sauce, for serving (optional)","1060 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
If using broccoli, trim the ends of the stems and discard, then cut the stems off near the base of the florets. Cut off the thick peel around the stems, then cut the stems into ½-inch slices. Cut the broccoli crowns into small florets. Drain the tofu and cut into 1-inch cubes.
Step 2
Open the can of coconut milk and spoon off an inch or so of the hard white solid part into a large saucepan with a lid. (If the milk is all liquid, add a few spoonfuls.) Turn the heat to medium-high. When the solids melt, add the onion and broccoli stems, if using, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. The coconut milk liquid should have evaporated, so the onions should be sizzling in coconut oil and the milk solids should be brown and smell toasty. Scrape up any bits sticking to the bottom.
Step 3
Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the curry powder and stir until evenly mixed, about 10 seconds. Add the remaining coconut milk, stir and bring to a simmer. Add the tofu and spread the cubes in an even layer, then top with the broccoli florets or other vegetables, sprinkle with salt and cover with the lid. Cook until the vegetables are just tender but still bright green, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 4
Gently stir so the vegetables are also coated in sauce. Taste and stir in more curry powder, salt and pepper if you’d like. Serve hot over rice or other grains or noodles, with hot sauce if you want.

¼
cup soy sauce, or to taste
2
tablespoons unsalted butter
4
large eggs

Yum Yum Sauce, for serving","1260 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat a very large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over high. Add the olive oil and shrimp, and sprinkle with salt and the garlic powder. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp is no longer translucent and begins to turn golden at the edges, 2 to 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the shrimp to a plate and set aside.
Step 2
Add the onion and mixed vegetables to the shrimpy oil and cook, stirring occasionally, just until the onion loses its raw edge but is still crunchy, and the vegetables are mostly thawed, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice and soy sauce and cook, stirring occasionally, until well combined and the rice begins to crisp underneath where it meets the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more soy sauce as needed.
Step 3
Scooch the rice to one side of the pan, lower the heat to medium and melt the butter on the empty side of the pan. Crack the eggs into the melted butter, break the yolks and stir vigorously to scramble the eggs, cooking just until they have set but are still tender, about 1 minute. Stir the soft scrambled eggs into the rice, add the reserved shrimp and any accumulated juices, then remove the pan from the heat.
Step 4
Let the fried rice sit for a few minutes so that it can continue to crisp in the pan’s residual heat. (If you haven’t already made the yum yum sauce, this is the perfect time to do it.)
Step 5
Drizzle most of the yum yum sauce over the fried rice in the skillet, leaving some back, if desired, to serve in a small dish on the side for dipping the shrimp.

Broil until the salmon is opaque with a deep brown crust, about 6 to 8 minutes for medium-rare. (The center of the fillets will be dark pink, if you pierce one with a paring knife and take a look.) If your fillets are thinner, reduce cooking time by 1 to 2 minutes. If you prefer more well-done fish, add 1 or 2 minutes to the cooking time.

cup finely chopped white onion (from 1 small onion)
2
tablespoons fresh lime juice (from about 1 lime)

Salt and black pepper
1
jalapeño
2
ripe avocados","158 user ratings","10 minutes","Step 1
In a medium bowl, combine the onion and lime juice, and season with salt and pepper. Let that sit as you chop the jalapeño.
Step 2
Cut the hard stem end off of the jalapeño and discard, then slice the chile in half lengthwise. If you don’t want the spice, use your knife or a spoon to remove the inner seeds and white membrane (this is where most of the chile’s heat resides). If you enjoy the heat, then leave all of that in. Chop the jalapeño as finely as you can and add to the bowl with the onion and lime juice. Be sure to wash your hands very well with soap after handling spicy chiles like jalapeños, and whatever you do, do not touch your eyes after handling them.
Step 3
Cut the avocados in half lengthwise and pull the halves apart. You can use your knife to pit the avocados, but a safer way is to hold the avocado half in one hand so that your thumb is touching the skin side where the pit is and your index and middle fingers are touching the flesh side around the pit. Gently press your fingers into each other to pop the pit out; with a ripe avocado, it should come out very easily. Use your hands to squeeze the avocado flesh out into the bowl with the other ingredients, or scoop it out with a spoon.
Step 4
Using a fork, gently mash the avocados against the side of the bowl until they are mashed to your desired consistency, then stir them into the other ingredients until well combined. Taste and add more salt if desired.
Step 5
Contrary to popular belief, adding avocado pits to guacamole does nothing to prevent oxidation, but if you press a good layer of plastic wrap or parchment paper directly over the guacamole and store it in the refrigerator, it will keep well for up to 2 days.

(7-ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce

Shredded extra-sharp Cheddar, sour cream and whole cilantro leaves, for serving (optional)","1249 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon, until translucent and starting to brown at the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 2
Use a fork to fish the tomatoes out of the can and add them to the pot, leaving behind the juice for now. Season with salt and cook the tomatoes, breaking them up with the wooden spoon and stirring occasionally, until jammy and their liquid has reduced significantly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 3
Stir in the chili powder and cook until fragrant, just a few seconds. Add the ground turkey, season with salt and stir to combine, breaking up the meat with the spoon. (Don’t worry about browning or cooking it through here, as it will do so when it simmers.) Stir in the reserved liquid from the tomato can.
Step 4
Use the fork to fish out as many chipotle peppers from the can as you would like, starting with two or three, and add to the pot, breaking them up with the wooden spoon, along with all of the adobo sauce. The more peppers you use, the spicier your final chili will be; if you like spice, just add the entire can. (Store any peppers you don’t use in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week and in the freezer for up to 2 months.) Fill the empty chipotle can with cold tap water, swish it around and add to the pot. Stir to combine.
Step 5
Bring the chili to a simmer over medium-high heat — you should see occasional small bubbles breaking the surface of the mixture — then cover the pot and reduce the heat to continue simmering over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has reduced and the tomatoes have broken down, about 20 minutes. The chili should look thick and shiny, but not too thick that you couldn’t ladle it into a bowl. (If it's too watery, then simmer with the lid off for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.) Taste and add more salt if desired. Serve with cheese, sour cream and cilantro, if using.

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
Gently pat the artichoke hearts with a paper towel to remove excess moisture. Place the artichoke hearts in a mound in the center of the baking sheet. Add 2 tablespoons oil and 1 teaspoon salt, season with pepper and gently toss to combine. Scatter the artichoke hearts in an even layer and roast for 20 minutes. Flip the hearts and roast for an additional 10 minutes, until browned and a little crisp around the edges.
Step 3
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes or according to package directions.
Step 4
While the pasta cooks, in a serving dish large enough to accommodate the spaghetti, add the Parmesan, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper and the lemon zest; toss to combine. Add the lemon juice and the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; stir to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick paste.
Step 5
Place the serving dish next to the pasta pot. Scoop out and reserve 1 cup of the pasta water. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of it over the Parmesan-lemon mixture; stir to thin out the mixture a little.
Step 6
Using tongs, lift out some of the spaghetti (with its cooking water still clinging to it) and transfer to the Parmesan-lemon mixture; quickly toss and drag the spaghetti in a circular motion around the dish to incorporate the sauce. Repeat until you have transferred and tossed all of the spaghetti.
Step 7
Add the butter, basil and 1 tablespoon of the pasta water to the spaghetti, and keep tossing until you have a silky sauce clinging to it. Add more pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed.

½
ounce/15 grams store-bought white or pink meringues, roughly crushed (½ cup)
2
tablespoons/19 grams popping candy (optional)","304 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes, plus cooling ","Step 1
Make the cupcakes: Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit/180 degrees Celsius. Line a standard muffin tin with 12 paper liners.
Step 2
Use a small, sharp knife to trim the ends of the lemon and then cut away all the skin and pith. Slide your knife between the membranes to release the segments, then roughly chop each segment into 3 or 4 pieces. You need 24 pieces in total. Stuff each of the raspberries with the lemon pieces and set aside.
Step 3
Add the butter, sugar and cream-soda extract to the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place. (Alternatively, do this in a large bowl with a hand-held mixer). Mix on medium-high speed for about 3 minutes, or until pale, fluffy and aerated. Scrape down the sides if needed, then turn the speed to medium and add the eggs, one at a time, making sure each is completely incorporated.
Step 4
Scrape the bowl. Then, with the speed on medium-low, add the mascarpone, flour, baking powder and salt, and mix to combine. Turn the speed to medium and mix for 15 seconds, or until everything is smooth and evenly combined. Use two spoons to evenly divide the batter among the liners, so they are about two-thirds full. Press two raspberries, hole sides up, into the center of a cupcake so they’re submerged halfway in the batter. Repeat with the remaining berries and cupcakes.
Step 5
Bake for 30 minutes, or until springy to the touch and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Leave to cool for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.
Step 6
Once the cupcakes are cool, make the toppings: Blitz the raspberries into a smooth purée using a small food processor or blender. (Alternatively, mash them very thoroughly with a fork.) For the frosting, add the mascarpone, cream, sugar and cream-soda extract to the bowl of a stand mixer with the whisk attachment in place. Start the mixer on low, then gradually increase the speed to medium-high and whisk for about 1½ minutes, or until soft to medium peaks form. You don’t want it to be runny at all. (Alternatively, do this in a bowl with a hand-held mixer.) Add the blitzed raspberries, stirring just 3 or 4 times and not more so that the frosting is streaky with red bits throughout.
Step 7
Fit a piping bag with a star-shaped piping tip (about 1 ¼-inches/30-millimeters wide) if you have one. (Alternatively, snip a hole in a piping bag or resealable plastic bag.) Place the bag tip-side down into a cup and fold the top over the rim to help keep it upright. Use a spatula to transfer the mascarpone cream to the bag and then pipe tall swirls of the cream on top of the cupcakes. Just before serving, sprinkle with the meringue and, if using, the popping candy.
Cream-soda flavor extract is available online and at professional baking shops. Be sure to buy extract made for baking and not for flavoring soda water. It is a speciality product, but it really makes these very special.

Turn off the heat, then use a slotted spoon to transfer everything but the cooking liquid to a blender. (Don’t drain the pot; you’ll use that water to cook the pasta.) Set the blender aside to cool slightly.
Step 2
Meanwhile, return the pot of water to a boil; add more water if a lot evaporated in Step 1. Add the pasta and cook until tender (or according to box directions).
Step 3
To the blender, add ½ cup water, the garlic and the red-pepper flakes. Blend on high until very smooth. Season to taste with salt.
Step 4
Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain the pasta. Return the pasta to the pot and add the green sauce. Stir vigorously to combine, adding pasta water as needed to loosen the sauce and help it cling to the noodles. (Sauce will thicken as it cools.) Add the lemon juice, season to taste with salt and red-pepper flakes, and eat right away.

pound fresh or frozen tteok (rice cakes)
½
cup shredded cheese, such as sharp Cheddar or low-moisture mozzarella
5
ounces green cabbage, shredded (about 2 cups)","349 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Bring a small pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add the eggs carefully and reduce the heat to gently simmer the eggs until soft-boiled, 7 minutes. Drain the eggs, leaving them in their pot, then gently shake the pot to crack their shells. Cover the cracked eggs with cold water to shock them, then let cool enough to touch. Once they are sufficiently cooled, peel the eggs directly in the water (they should peel easily); set aside.
Step 2
In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, gochujang, soy sauce and garlic. Set aside.
Step 3
In a large pan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallots, season generously with salt and cook, stirring constantly, until the edges of the shallots are really brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the gochujang mixture and cook, stirring for a few seconds, just until the sauce loses its raw edge.
Step 4
Stir in 1 cup cold tap water and add the tteok, making sure to separate them if stuck together. Bring to a simmer over medium-high and cook until the sauce thickens and the tteok are heated through but still chewy, 4 to 6 minutes. (Add a minute or two if using frozen rice cakes.)
Step 5
To serve, scatter over the cheese, followed by the cabbage — a nice, crunchy blanket of it. Cover to let the cheese melt; the cabbage will steam slightly and lose some of its raw edge. Halve the soft-boiled eggs and arrange them over the crunchy, cheesy cabbage.

small parsnip, peeled, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise into half-moons
7
garlic cloves, crushed and coarsely chopped

Salt
3
tablespoons fish sauce
2
tablespoons soy sauce

Steamed white rice, for serving","38 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the mussels and seaweed: Put on a kettle of water to boil. Place the mussels in a medium bowl, pour over enough hot water to cover by 1 inch and soak them until they open, about 15 minutes. In a large bowl, add the dried seaweed and enough cold water to cover by 3 inches; let soak for about 15 minutes as well. During this time, the seaweed will expand considerably.
Step 2
Dump the mussels into a clean sink and spray with cold running water so they’re easier to handle. Open each mussel and, using your fingers, carefully scoop out the flesh. (The best way to do this is to loosen the edges of the mussel first, then peel the mussel off the shell in one piece.) Place all the scooped mussels into their original medium bowl, rinse with cold water, drain well and refrigerate until ready to use. Drain the soaked seaweed and set aside.
Step 3
Make the soup: In a large pot or Dutch oven, add the anchovies, anchovy oil, sesame oil, onion, parsnip and garlic, and turn the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the anchovies break down and the vegetables become fragrant and lightly browned at the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 4
Add 6 cups water, plus the fish sauce, soy sauce and the drained seaweed. Bring to a boil over high, stirring occasionally, then reduce the heat and simmer, partly covered, until the seaweed is soft and slippery and the broth is deeply flavored with seaside savoriness, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and season with salt if needed. Stir in the mussels, bring back to a vigorous boil and serve the soup hot, with bowls of white rice.

Coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
4
tablespoons toasted sesame oil
2
pounds thinly sliced pork belly, cut into 2-inch strips (see Tip)

Steamed white rice, for serving","77 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Make the pa muchim: In a medium bowl, toss to combine the scallions, vinegar, gochugaru, sesame oil and sugar. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.
Step 2
Prepare the samgyeopsal spread: Wash and dry the lettuces and arrange on a large platter. Thinly slice the garlic cloves and place on a small plate, scooching the slices to one side. Make the doenjang honey by dabbing the doenjang onto the other side of the plate and drizzling the honey over the doenjang. Make the dipping sauce by adding 1 teaspoon salt and a generous grind of black pepper to 4 small dishes (or however many are dining); drizzle each dish with 1 tablespoon sesame oil.
Step 3
Cook the pork belly: Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add half of the pork belly and cook, stirring occasionally, until the edges are crispy and lightly browned but the centers are still plump and meaty, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a towel-lined platter. Drain the fat from the pan and discard. Repeat with the remaining pork belly. Serve immediately with bowls of fresh white rice.
Step 4
To eat, dip the fried pork belly into the dipping sauce, then place on a lettuce leaf. Smear some of the doenjang honey onto the pork belly, top with a slice of raw garlic and a small chopstickful of pa muchim. Fold the lettuce wrap into a bundle and eat. Chase with the white rice. Another lovely thing to do: Dip the lettuces into the doenjang honey or dipping sauce, and eat them like crudités between bites of crispy pork belly.
You can buy thinly sliced pork belly at Korean grocery stores, sometimes as long strips and often as individual rolled pieces made easy for grilling. You can also purchase pork belly as a long, thick slab, which can be sliced as thinly or thickly as you like. All that matters is that your pork is uncured and unseasoned, as it’s the pure flavor of the meat that makes samgyeopsal such a dream to eat.

pounds beef leg bones (see Tip)
1
pound brisket or chuck roast
8
scallions, thinly sliced
8
garlic cloves, finely grated
4
teaspoons flaky sea salt, plus more as desired

Steamed white rice, for serving

Very ripe radish kimchi, for serving","117 user ratings","3½ hours","Step 1
Place the beef bones and brisket in a very large stockpot (the biggest you have), and add enough cold tap water to fully cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until the bones and meat are no longer pink and a gray foam collects at the surface, about 10 minutes. Drain in a colander and rinse the bones under cold tap water. Rinse out the pot, as well, if it is especially dirty, and add back the bones and meat.
Step 2
Add 5 quarts cold tap water to the pot and bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to gently boil. Partly cover and cook until the soup is rich with marrow flavor and milky-white in color, about 3 hours. (For the milkiest soup, you want to maintain this gentle boil, which should be more vigorous than a simmer but less volatile than a hard boil.) During these 3 hours, you don’t need to stir, but you should check the water level once or twice to make sure the bones stay covered with liquid; add more cold tap water to the pot if this level gets too low, which can happen if your stove is especially strong.
Step 3
Carefully drain the contents of the pot into a colander set in a large bowl. Take out the brisket, slice it thinly against the grain and set aside. Rinse, cool and freeze the bones to use them again another time. At this point, you can refrigerate the soup overnight to remove the fat, which will harden on top once chilled and be easy to remove (don’t forget to refrigerate the brisket, too), or you can pour it back into a clean pot and, just before serving, bring to a simmer over medium heat, skimming the fat off the top with a ladle. Season generously with salt.
Step 4
While the soup is reheating for serving, prepare the scallion garnish: In a small bowl, stir together the scallions, garlic and flaky sea salt.
Step 5
Divide the brisket among large bowls and ladle over the hot soup. Sprinkle some of the scallion garnish over each bowl, leaving the rest on the table so everyone can add more as they eat. The soup should be well seasoned with salt and aromatic from the savory scallions and garlic. Serve with white rice and radish kimchi.
You can find bags of frozen beef bones for bone soups like this seolleongtang at Korean supermarkets, where they are often labeled, austerely, “beef bones” or “beef leg bones.” At other grocery stores and butcher shops, they might be labeled “beef marrow bones.” All that matters is that you use a marrow-rich beef bone for this recipe, as marrow is the main flavoring in seolleongtang.

Heat oven to 425 degrees and, if you like, line a sheet pan with parchment paper (not essential but helpful for cleaning up).
Step 2
Trim the ends off 1 lemon, then cut the lemon in half crosswise.Thinly slice one half of the lemon into rounds, then cut the rounds into quarters, creating small triangles. Shake out the seeds then place the lemon quarters into a large bowl. Save the remaining lemon half for serving. Cut the remaining whole lemon into wedges, for serving.
Step 3
Add chicken and potatoes to the large bowl with the lemon quarters. Add the oregano, salt and pepper; toss well. (Your hands are the best tools here.) Drizzle in the oil and toss again.
Step 4
Arrange chicken thighs skin side up on one half of the prepared sheet pan, and potatoes and lemons on the other, spreading the potatoes out into one layer. Roast for 20 minutes. Using a long-handled spoon, stir the potatoes, then spread them out again in one layer. (You don’t have to touch the chicken.) Continue roasting until chicken and potatoes are cooked through and everything is golden and crisped, another 15 to 20 minutes (40 to 45 minutes total roasting time).
Step 5
To serve, squeeze the juice from the lemon half all over chicken and potatoes and give everything a good stir to incorporate all the tasty juices and browned bits at the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle with more oregano and salt, and serve with additional lemon wedges and condiments on the side.
You can substitute 1¼ pounds chicken drumsticks for the thighs, or use a combination of thighs and drumsticks. Bone-in, skin-on breasts can also be substituted; because they cook more quickly than dark meat does, you’ll need to start checking on them after 30 minutes of total roasting time.

Place the rice in a sieve and rinse it under cold running water, shaking constantly, just a few seconds. Add the rinsed rice and 2 cups cold water to a rice cooker or medium pot and soak for 10 minutes. If using a rice cooker, turn it on and cook rice until soft and fluffy. If using a pot, bring the water to a simmer over high heat, then reduce the heat to very low, cover and continue simmering, without peeking, for 20 minutes; remove the pot from the heat and let the rice finish steaming, still covered, until the grains are soft, distended and a little shiny, about 10 minutes. Uncover your cooked rice, fluff with a fork and set aside.

cup fish sauce
½
cup gochugaru
1
tablespoon granulated sugar
1
bunch scallions, chopped into ½-inch pieces","273 user ratings","4 ¼ hours, plus at least 2 days’ fermenting","Step 1
Dry-brine the cabbage: Rinse the cabbage quarters under cold running water and place on a large rimmed sheet pan. Generously salt the cabbage all over, making sure to season between the leaves as well as the outsides. (Don’t worry about being too precise; since the cabbages leak water, the salt will distribute evenly into the brine.) Set aside to brine at room temperature, cut sides up, until the hard leaves become limp and soggy, about 4 hours, flipping once or twice halfway through. During this brining time, the cabbage quarters should release plenty of water into the sheet pan.
Step 2
Make the sauce: Quarter one of the apples, leaving it unpeeled. Core it, coarsely chop it, then add it to a food processor. Add the onion, garlic and ginger, and process until finely chopped. Add the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the fish sauce, gochugaru and sugar. Peel the remaining apple, quarter it, core it, then thinly slice it crosswise. Fold the chopped scallions and thinly sliced apple into the sauce.
Step 3
Rinse the salted cabbage quarters under cold running water, squeezing them of their excess liquid. Place one cabbage quarter into the bowl with the sauce. With clean hands, smear ¼ of the sauce all over the outsides and between each leaf, tucking in the larger pieces of scallions and apple as well. Fold the cabbage quarter in half crosswise, gathering the leafy tail ends together and bringing them up and over the root end, to create a compact bundle. Place the bundle in the jar and repeat with the remaining three cabbage quarters until you have used up most of the sauce and the jar is filled with sauced cabbage, leaving about an inch of room on top. (A few air gaps are fine; they’ll fill with liquid over time.) Top the jar with any remaining sauce left behind in the bowl. Loosely close with a lid (see Tip). You can wash your hands at this stage.
Step 4
Let the jar of kimchi begin fermenting on the kitchen counter at room temperature for 2 to 3 days. After this, the cabbage should have released even more of its liquid; it’s OK if the liquid doesn’t completely cover the cabbage at this point, though it may. (This is a very juicy recipe.) Refrigerate the kimchi to finish fermenting until it’s sour, 2 to 3 weeks and up to 6 months, at which point it will be very, very sour and should be eaten or turned into jjigae. Check (and taste!) the kimchi every 2 to 3 days both to familiarize yourself with the fermentation process but also to allow gas to escape, which you can do by opening the lid every so often. As you go through the jar over time, take out one cabbage quarter at a time and chop it into bite-size pieces to serve. You can eat the core or toss it.
One of the best containers for kimchi is a glass jar with a plastic lid. Stainless steel containers with metal lids (the kind that lock into place) are also traditionally used. Both types can be found online or at Korean supermarkets and work well for kimchi since the lids aren’t airtight. Avoid using Mason jars with airtight lids since they can explode as gas builds up during the fermentation process.

1
thin, boneless rib-eye steak (about 6 ounces), cut into 1-inch pieces

Steamed white rice, for serving","118 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
To a medium pot, add the doenjang, garlic, onion, zucchini, radish, mushrooms, dasima, anchovies, soy sauce and 3 cups cold tap water, and season lightly with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to gently boil, stirring once or twice, until the vegetables start to soften and the broth tastes intensely savory and as salty as the sea, about 10 minutes. Adjust seasoning with more doenjang or salt as desired; the stew should be assertively seasoned.
Step 2
Stir in the steak and continue gently boiling the jjigae, stirring once or twice, until the meat is just cooked through, about 5 minutes. Serve with bowls of fresh white rice.
You can find doenjang, often labeled “soybean paste,” in Korean or Asian supermarkets and online. Packed with umami and irresistible salinity, doenjang is a soulful flavor booster made of fermented soybeans and brine.
For unparalleled savoriness, drop it into pasta sauce, slick it over fish or whisk it into your favorite salad dressing.

teaspoon baking powder
¼
teaspoon fine sea salt
1
cup/227 grams salted cultured butter, at room temperature (see Tip)
⅔
cup/130 grams granulated sugar
1
large egg yolk
¼

For the Icing
1
cup confectioners’ sugar

cup/56 grams salted cultured butter, melted
1 to 2
tablespoons buttermilk or whole milk, plus more as needed
¼
teaspoon vanilla extract
⅛
teaspoon almond extract

Toasted sliced almonds, for topping","597 user ratings","1 hour, plus at least 2 hours' chilling","Step 1
In a large bowl, stir together flours, cornstarch, baking powder and salt.
Step 2
In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together butter and granulated sugar until lightened in color and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Beat in egg yolk and almond extract until combined, about 20 seconds. With the mixer running on low, add flour mixture, beating until just incorporated. Do not overmix.
Step 3
Divide dough into two balls. On a floured surface, roll each ball into a 1½-inch-thick log. (If the dough is too soft to work with, chill it for 20 to 30 minutes before forming it into logs.) Wrap logs tightly in parchment paper or plastic wrap, and refrigerate until very firm, at least 2 hours or overnight.
Step 4
When you are ready to bake the cookies, heat oven to 325 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.
Step 5
Use large, sharp knife to cut each log into ¼-inch-thick rounds. Place cookies 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.
Step 6
Bake until cookie edges and bottoms are golden brown, about 15 to 22 minutes. Cool 5 minutes on baking sheets, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Step 7
Make the icing: In a large bowl, whisk together confectioners’ sugar, melted butter, 1 tablespoon buttermilk, vanilla and almond extracts. If the icing isn’t thin enough to drizzle, add more buttermilk. It should be a little thicker than heavy cream.
Step 8
Using a fork, drizzle icing all over the cooled cookies, then top with almond slices if you like. Let the icing set for at least 1 hour, then store at room temperature in an airtight container. The cookies will keep for at least 3 days.
If you can’t get salted cultured butter, substitute regular butter, adding an extra ¼ teaspoon salt. The cookies will still be delicious.

Place a gallon-size resealable plastic bag in a large bowl. To the bag, add the soy sauce, salt, sugar, white pepper and 6 cups cold tap water; stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Nestle the Cornish game hens into the liquid, seal the bag set in the bowl and place in the refrigerator to brine for at least 8 hours and up to 48 hours.
Step 2
When ready to cook, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Drain the hens in the sink and pat very dry with a clean towel (the drier the hen, the crispier the skin). Using your hands, massage the olive oil all over the birds and place on a sheet pan, breast side up. Roast, rotating the pan halfway through, until golden brown and the legs, when jostled, feel like they’re about to fall off (a sign that the meat is tender and cooked through), about 1 hour.
Step 3
Meanwhile, in a small bowl, toss the scallions with the rice vinegar and a pinch of salt and sugar to taste. To serve, top each roasted hen with a mound of the scallion garnish and enjoy with steamed white rice and yangnyeom sauce (if using), for dipping.

In a large, wide pot or Dutch oven, arrange the onion, radish, Spam, sausages and kimchi in 5 individual piles. Over these piles, add the gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, fish sauce, garlic and 6 cups cold tap water. (Don’t worry about stirring at this stage.)
Step 2
Cover and bring to a rolling boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a gentle boil. Partly cover the pot and stir the liquid gently and occasionally while leaving the piles intact, until the sausage is warmed through and the broth is deeply seasoned with meaty flavor, 15 to 20 minutes. Taste and add salt as needed; this stew has many salty ingredients, but a little salt brings out the nuances of each component, resulting in a wonderful broth.
Step 3
Nestle in the noodles and cook according to package instructions, without stirring, until loose and chewy but not soggy and distended. Remove the pot from the heat. Top the noodles with the American cheese and cover until melted, just a few seconds. Scatter the scallions over the stew and serve immediately in the center of the table, family-style, with a ladle, tongs and bowls of fresh white rice.

½
cup all-purpose flour
2
large eggs
2
cups panko bread crumbs

Tonkatsu sauce, store-bought or homemade (optional)","113 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Set a medium pot of water to boil. As the water heats, wash, peel and quarter potatoes.
Step 2
Set potatoes in boiling water and cook until they’ve softened enough to pierce easily with a fork, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander. While potatoes are still warm, return them to the pot. Mash them until you’re left with a fluffy mixture, fold in butter until melted and set aside.
Step 3
While potatoes simmer, prepare the meat: Heat a skillet over medium, and add 1 tablespoon oil. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 3 to 4 minutes, then add beef. Cook, breaking the meat into bits, and add soy sauce, sugar and pepper. Continue cooking and stirring until the meat is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes.
Step 4
Add beef mixture to mashed potatoes in pot, and stir until thoroughly mixed. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let mixture cool until it’s warm (but not cold).
Step 5
With your palms, form the warm mixture into 1-inch-thick oval-shaped patties no longer than 3 inches in length. Set the patties on a baking sheet as you form them. You should end up with 10 to 12 patties.
Step 6
Cover the patties loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate to cool for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, organize your breading station: Place flour in a shallow plate, beat eggs in a shallow bowl and spread panko on another plate.
Step 7
Remove patties from fridge, and begin the breading process: Dip 1 patty into flour, covering completely. Then transfer to the beaten egg, covering completely. Then transfer to the panko, being sure to cover each patty completely. As you complete each patty, set back on the baking sheet before continuing with the next patty.
Step 8
Fill a medium saucepan with oil to a depth of 1½ inches and heat to 340 degrees. Deep-fry korokke in batches of 2 at a time. (If you add too many, the oil’s temperature will drop too drastically.) Fry, turning once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes. They’re already cooked inside, so use their color as your guide. Transfer to a cooling rack or a plate lined with paper towels, and repeat with the remaining korokke. Continually regulate the oil’s temperature throughout — if the heat is too high, the korokke will burn, and if it’s too cold, then your korokke will be soggy.
Step 9
Serve hot, with tonkatsu sauce, if you’d like.

1

cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing
3
fresh or dried bay leaves
1
teaspoon dried oregano

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground pepper

tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and freshly ground pepper
1
large shallot, minced
1
teaspoon red wine vinegar
2
tablespoons chopped capers

Torn fresh parsley leaves and tender stems","799 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Start the beans: Rinse the beans then add them to a large, heavy pot and cover with enough cool water to generously immerse (about 12 cups). Add ¼ cup olive oil, the bay leaves, oregano and 1 teaspoon salt, then bring to a boil over high heat. Once the liquid comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are very tender, 1½ to 2 hours. Add extra water by the cupful as needed to keep the beans immersed.
Step 2
Prepare the potatoes: Heat the oven to 375 degrees. On a large sheet pan, toss the potatoes with 2 tablespoons olive oil; season generously with salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Roast, stirring once about halfway through, until the potatoes are golden-brown and tender, about 30 minutes. Set aside.
Step 3
Finish the beans: In a large, deep skillet, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped garlic and sauté until soft and fragrant. As soon as the edges of the garlic start to color, add the red wine and simmer until the wine is reduced by half, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 4
Using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked beans (you should have about 7 cups) to the reduced wine in the skillet, then add about 2 cups of their cooking liquid — you want just enough to mostly cover the beans. Add the olives, prunes and another ¼ cup olive oil, and simmer over medium, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld and the liquid thickens slightly to form a sauce, 10 to 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 5
Finish the potatoes: In a medium bowl, combine the minced shallot with the red wine vinegar. Add the potatoes, capers and parsley, and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Tip the potatoes on top of the beans, drizzle with olive oil and serve.

Add the tomatillos, poblano, onion, serrano chiles and garlic to a large preheated comal or cast-iron skillet set over medium heat. Cook everything until lightly charred and soft on all sides, about 20 minutes. The poblano should take the longest to cook, while the garlic cloves will be done in about 5 to 8 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, heat a dry small to medium skillet over medium. Once warmed, toast the sesame seeds, stirring constantly, until golden and fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the toasted seeds to a large bowl and set aside.
Step 3
Toast the pepitas in the same skillet, stirring constantly, until golden, popped and fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Add them to the bowl with sesame seeds.
Step 4
Toast the almonds in the same skillet, stirring constantly, until lightly seared and fragrant, 4 to 5 minutes. Add them to the bowl with the seeds.

Toast the bay leaves and cloves until the leaves lightly brown and the cloves become fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add to the same bowl with the seeds.
Step 6
Stem and seed the charred chiles, and add them along with the remaining charred ingredients and the toasted ingredients to a blender. Add the romaine, cilantro, epazote, hoja santa (if using) and 2 ½ cups vegetable stock. Blend until almost smooth yet slightly lumpy and textured. Use more of the vegetable stock as needed to smooth out the mixture. If you don’t have a high-powered blender, you may need to blend in two batches, adding equal amounts of the wet and dry ingredients to each batch.
Step 7
Heat a large, deep pot over medium-low. Once warmed, add the oil. Once the oil is hot and shimmering, carefully add the mole from the blender. There will be some splatter. Stir in the salt and simmer the mole for 15 to 20 minutes, until the flavors meld together, stirring occasionally to make sure the mole doesn't burn at the bottom of the pot.
Step 8
Serve with seared mushrooms, tofu steaks or roasted cauliflower, paired with Mexican rice. Extra mole can be kept in the refrigerator for up to a week or frozen for up to 3 months in an airtight container.

cup/200 grams plus 2 tablespoons/25 grams granulated sugar

½ cup/120 milliliters half-and-half

¼ teaspoon ground sumac","309 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the strawberries: Combine the chopped strawberries, sumac, sugar and almond extract in a small bowl and set aside to macerate, a process of letting the berries soften and release their juices.
Step 2
Meanwhile, prepare the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-inch round cake pan or springform pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Step 3
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, salt, baking soda and baking powder to combine. Set aside.
Step 4
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or in a medium bowl using a handheld mixer, beat the eggs and 1 cup/200 grams sugar on medium-high speed until very pale and light yellow in color, about 3 minutes. The mixture should thicken and make ribbons that slowly lose their shape when they fall off the whisk attachment. With the mixer on high speed, slowly add the remaining 1 cup/240 milliliters olive oil and beat until everything is combined.
Step 5
Reduce the speed to medium-low and slowly begin adding the dry ingredients in 3 additions, adding the half-and-half in between additions. Mix until just combined. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and fold in the diced strawberries and their liquid. Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top with a spatula. Arrange the halved strawberries on the top.
Step 6
Bake for 50 to 65 minutes, until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If the cake is becoming too brown before the center has set, cover loosely with foil.
Step 7
In a small bowl, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons/25 grams sugar with the sumac. Sprinkle the cake with the sumac sugar while still slightly warm.
Step 8
Allow the cake to cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Turn the cake out of the pan onto the rack or release the springform ring and remove it. (If using a standard cake pan, some sugar may fall off of the cake. Use parchment or wax paper to catch any stray sugar and sprinkle back over the cake.) Let cool completely before serving. Store leftover cake in an airtight container or wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for up to 1 day (or refrigerate up to 4 days).

Divide the fennel fronds, if using, between two ice cube trays. Fill with filtered water and freeze until solid, 4 to 8 hours.

Meanwhile, place the watermelon in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth. Scrape the sides of the blender or food processor using a rubber spatula and blend again.
Step 3
Place a fine metal sieve over a large bowl and strain the pureed watermelon through the sieve. (This should yield 2 to 3 cups of juice). Store in the refrigerator until ready to serve; it will keep in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
Step 4
To serve, fill four highball glasses or rocks glasses with the ice cubes. Stir the watermelon juice and add ½ cup to each glass. Top off with ½ cup ginger beer.
Unlike ginger ale, ginger beer is fermented. It’s nonalcoholic and has a spicy kick and tends to have more flavor than the soft drink. If buying ginger beer from the store, try finding the options from Barritt’s or Bruce Cost.

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil

½ teaspoon hot sauce (optional)","170 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the slaw: Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high (400 degrees). Place the poblanos on the hot grill over direct heat. Cook until the skin is charred, 12 to 15 minutes, turning once or twice. (If using a gas grill, keep the grill covered between flips.) Transfer to a cutting board and let cool. Remove the stems and seeds then finely chop. (The poblanos can be grilled ahead. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, up to 1 day.)
Step 2
Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, vinegar, celery seed and salt until combined, then gradually whisk in the olive oil until well blended. Whisk in the hot sauce, if using.
Step 3
Finish the slaw: In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, chopped poblanos, scallions, vinegar, sugar and salt; let stand for about 10 minutes. This process breaks down the cabbage and produces liquid. Feel free to pour off excess liquid before adding dressing. Add the dressing and toss until well combined and serve. The slaw can be made up to 2 days in advance. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate. Pour off excess liquid before serving. Your cabbage should be tender with a crunch.

½
cup peach jam
¼
cup unsulfured molasses
1
tablespoon apple cider vinegar

1
tablespoon soy sauce
1
tablespoon coriander seeds, crushed
1
tablespoon ground mustard
½
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
For the Chicken
3 to 4
pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs

1½ teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)

½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

1½ tablespoons peanut oil
1
tablespoon coriander seeds, crushed","882 user ratings","About 1 hour","Step 1
Make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the peach jam, molasses, vinegar and ½ cup water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to combine. Once boiling, reduce the heat to maintain a vigorous simmer and whisk in the tomato paste, soy sauce, coriander, ground mustard and salt. Simmer for 6 to 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thickened; the sauce should be reduced to about 1 cup. The sauce can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. (Before using, bring to room temperature and thin with a few teaspoons of hot water if the sauce has become too thick to brush.)
Step 2
Prepare the chicken: Leaving one section free of coals on a charcoal grill or leaving one burner off on a gas grill, heat a grill to medium (350 degrees). Pat the chicken thighs very dry with paper towels. Season both sides with the salt and pepper. Coat with the peanut oil.
Step 3
Place the chicken thighs on the hot grill, skin-side down, close the grill lid and cook, moving the chicken away from any flare-ups, for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the skin lifts easily from the grill grates. Transfer a few tablespoons of the sauce to a small bowl and set aside. Flip the chicken thighs and use a heat-resistant brush to coat with some of the remaining sauce. Cover the grill again and cook for another 5 to 8 minutes, then flip and baste with the sauce again. Grill with the lid open for another 10 minutes, or until the thighs reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. (If the skin starts to burn, flip the chicken and move to the cool part of the grill.) Flip the chicken skin-side up one last time and rest on an upper rack or the cool side of the grill for 10 minutes, using a clean brush and the reserved sauce to baste once more.
Step 4
Transfer the chicken to a platter and sprinkle the tops with the crushed coriander, then serve.

Handful of torn basil, plus more for serving","1684 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Heat a large (about 12-inch), well-seasoned cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-high; add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Add the gnocchi to the pan, breaking up any that are stuck together. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, tossing every 1 ½ to 2 minutes so they get golden and crispy all over.
Step 2
Meanwhile, prepare your tomatoes: If you are using small ones like cherry or grape varieties, simply slice them in half. For larger tomatoes, quarter them or slice into bite-size chunks. (It is good to have a mix of shapes and sizes.) Place the tomatoes and onions in a large serving bowl. Add the balsamic vinegar and 1 teaspoon salt; season with pepper and gently toss.
Step 3
When the gnocchi are golden and crispy, add them to the tomatoes, along with 3 to 4 tablespoons of olive oil and a handful each of parsley and basil. Toss and taste, adding more salt or pepper as needed.

¼
cup plus 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan

Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2
wide slices sturdy country white bread, such as sourdough or peasant bread (preferably from the middle of the loaf)
8
ounces asparagus, trimmed
3
scallions, thinly sliced
3
fresh thyme sprigs
1
tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil","321 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 425 degrees. Grease a rimmed sheet pan with 1 tablespoon melted butter.
Step 2
In a large, shallow dish, whisk together 1 egg, milk, ¼ cup Parmesan, a large pinch of salt and pepper, and the remaining tablespoon melted butter. Add bread and let soak for about 2 minutes per side. The bread should be soft and soaked through, but not falling apart.
Step 3
Arrange soaked bread on one side of the prepared sheet pan. Pour any remaining soaking mixture from bowl onto the bread slices. Using a cookie cutter or a knife, carefully cut 2 (2½-inch) holes in each slice of soaked bread, making 4 holes in total. Place the cut-out rounds alongside the bread slices on the pan.
Step 4
On the other side of the sheet pan, add the asparagus, half of the scallions (save the rest for garnish), thyme and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Drizzle asparagus with olive oil, tossing well, and spread into an even single layer.
Step 5
Bake until bread is golden on top, 10 minutes. If the asparagus is tender and browned after 10 minutes, use tongs to transfer the stalks to a plate and tent with foil to keep warm. Thick asparagus may need more time, in which case leave it in the pan for the next step.
Step 6
Using a spatula, flip the bread slices and cut-outs. Crack the remaining 4 eggs into the holes (the eggs may overflow a bit, and that is OK). Season eggs lightly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan on top of eggs and bread.
Step 7
Return pan to the oven and bake until eggs are barely set, about 5 to 7 minutes. The yolks and even some of the whites should jiggle slightly. (Note that the eggs will continue to cook on the sheet pan once out of the oven, so if you like runny yolks, err on the side of early removal.) However, if the egg whites are still translucent, bake for another minute or two.
Step 8
To serve, place egg toasts on plates, top each toast with half the asparagus (discarding the thyme sprigs) and garnish with reserved scallions.

Step 3
Reduce the heat to medium, add the ginger and garlic pastes and the green chiles, and stir to combine. Add the spice mixture and stir to combine into a fragrant paste, about 1 minute. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the tea and scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add the chickpeas and tomato sauce. Let the mixture come to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a very low simmer and cook, uncovered, for 15 to 25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced and slightly darkened in color and the flavors have mellowed slightly.
Step 4
In a small saucepan or skillet, warm the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high heat. Add the julienned ginger and a generous pinch of hing, and cook, swirling the pan, until the ginger sizzles and the mixture is fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir the mixture into the chickpeas. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Top with cilantro and serve with flatbreads.
Frozen Indian breads are an extremely useful freezer staple. You can buy frozen bhatura and other breads at any Indian grocery.

Using a slotted spoon, remove guanciale to a small dish and set aside. Transfer the pan drippings to a small bowl, leaving about 1 tablespoon in the skillet.
Step 3
Increase heat to medium-high and stir the onion into the pan drippings, allowing it to soften, about 1 minute. Add the sausage and 1 teaspoon salt and break up the meat into small pieces. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sausage has browned, about 5 minutes.
Step 4
Stir in the tomato paste, then the cherry tomatoes. Decrease heat to medium and stir in the wine. Cover the sauce with a lid and cook for 5 minutes.
Step 5
Remove the lid and, using the back of a spoon, break up the tomatoes and incorporate them into the sauce. Allow the sauce to cook, uncovered, for 5 more minutes.
Step 6
In a small bowl, combine the egg yolks, ¼ cup cheese, the pepper and 1 tablespoon of the reserved guanciale drippings.
Step 7
Add the pasta and guanciale to the simmering sauce and stir to coat.
Step 8
Stir 2 tablespoons of the pasta water into the egg mixture. Turn off the heat and stir the egg mixture into the pasta until coated and glossy, adding 2 tablespoons more pasta water if needed. Transfer the pasta to a serving dish and top with additional cheese, if desired.

"Chocolate Chile Biscotti","Italian,Cookies And Bars,Cashew,Chocolate Chip,Cocoa Powder,Dessert,Christmas","Yield: 36 to 40 small biscotti","2
cups/272 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
⅓
cup/32 grams Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1½
teaspoons baking powder
¼
teaspoon salt
½
cup/114 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
¾
cup/151 grams granulated sugar, plus more for sprinkling
2
tablespoons ancho chile powder
2
large eggs
1
teaspoon vanilla extract
⅔
cup/85 grams roasted and unsalted cashews, roughly chopped
½
cup/100 grams chocolate chips (any type)","655 user ratings","1¼ hours, plus 3 hours’ cooling","Step 1
Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar and chile powder on medium-low speed until smooth and well combined, about 2 minutes.
Step 3
Increase the speed to medium. With the mixer running, add the eggs, 1 at a time, pausing to scrape down the sides of the bowl if needed, then add the vanilla extract. Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute.
Step 4
Turn the speed to low and, with the mixer running, add the flour mixture a little at a time. Continue mixing until the dry ingredients are almost incorporated, scraping the bowl as needed, then add the cashews and chocolate chips all at once. Keep mixing until the cashews and chocolate have integrated and a thick dough has formed.
Step 5
Divide the dough in half and roll each half into a 12-inch log. (You can use a sheet of wax or parchment paper to help roll the dough evenly, or dust with extra flour if the dough is sticky.) Place both logs on a half-sheet pan lined with parchment paper, then flatten both logs with your palms until about 1-inch thick. Sprinkle each with a little granulated sugar to evenly coat.
Step 6
Bake until the logs lose their sheen, 20 to 25 minutes. There should still be some softness in the middle of each log when gently pressed. Be careful not to overbake, as the logs may break when sliced later.
Step 7
Turn off the oven, take out the biscotti and let cool on the sheet pan for a few hours. (The longer they rest, the easier they will be to slice without breaking.)
Step 8
For the second bake, heat the oven to 300 degrees. (The temperature is lower for gentler, more even baking.)
Step 9
Using a serrated knife, slice each log at an angle into ½-inch slices. You may trim and discard the ends or bake them along with the other slices — they taste just as good. Place the slices, cut sides down, on the same parchment-lined half-sheet pan. (You don’t need to be careful about spacing them out.)
Step 10
Bake for about 25 minutes, or until the biscotti are no longer soft to the touch. They will harden a little further after cooling. Remove from the oven and cool completely on the pan. The biscotti will keep for 2 weeks in an airtight container at room temperature.

Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 2
Prepare the topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, butter, vanilla extract and cinnamon (if using). Pour the mixture into an ungreased 9-inch pie dish or round cake pan that’s at least 2 inches deep.
Step 3
Using a clean kitchen towel or a paper towel, blot any excess liquid off the fruit. Arrange the pineapple slices to your liking in a single layer on top of the brown sugar-butter mixture, covering the base of the pan, then add the cherries wherever there’s a gap. Place the pan in the refrigerator while you prepare the rest of the cake.
Step 4
Prepare the cake: In a medium bowl, whisk together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; set aside.
Step 5
Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter on high speed until creamy, about 1 minute. Add sugar and beat on high speed until creamed together, about 1 minute, scraping down the sides and the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
Step 6
On high speed, beat in the eggs, one at a time, until combined, then beat in the yogurt and vanilla extract, scraping the bowl as needed.
Step 7
Pour the dry cake flour mixture into the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer to low speed and carefully pour in the milk. Beat on low speed just until all the ingredients are combined. Do not overmix. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.
Step 8
Remove the pan from the refrigerator. Pour and spread the cake batter evenly over the topping.
Step 9
Bake for 40 to 55 minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean. (A couple moist crumbs are OK.)
Step 10
Remove cake from the oven and cool on a wire rack for 20 minutes. Run a knife along the edge to loosen, then invert the cake onto a plate. (Take care, as the pan may still be hot.) Serve warm or at room temperature.

Make the dressing: Place raisins and red onion in a small bowl. Add vinegar, sugar, ¾ teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons of water, and toss to combine. Leave to pickle for 10 minutes while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.
Step 2
Peel the woody exterior from the broccoli stalks and discard. Chop the stalks into ½-inch pieces. Chop the broccoli florets into ½-inch pieces. (The pieces do not have to be uniform or the same shape.) Place all the broccoli into a large mixing bowl.
Step 3
After 10 minutes, finish the dressing by adding the olive oil and sesame oil to the bowl with the pickling raisins and red onion, and stir well to combine. Taste and season with more salt if needed. It should be tangy, slightly sweet and a little salty.
Step 4
Add the raisin-and-onion dressing to the broccoli along with the apple and scallions. Using two large spoons, toss well so that everything is well coated. Season with ½ teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste. Taste to make sure you are happy with the seasonings, adding more if needed.

pound shallots, peeled
2
cups vegetable oil

Kosher salt","61 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Using a mandoline, slice the shallots into 1/16-​inch-​thick rounds. Line a rimmed baking sheet with 6 layers of paper towels. Set a fine-​mesh strainer over a large heatproof bowl or medium saucepan.
Step 2
Combine shallots and oil in a medium saucepan or wok. Place over medium-​high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until the shallots begin to bubble, 2 to 3 minutes. Continue cooking, stirring constantly as the shallots fry to ensure even cooking, until the shallots turn pale golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes longer. (The shallots will continue cooking for a brief period after draining, so do not allow them to get too dark.) Working quickly, pour the contents of the saucepan into the strainer. Save oil for another use, like stir-frying noodles or fried rice, or for using in marinades, or as the base of homemade chili oil.
Step 3
Immediately transfer the shallots to the prepared baking sheet, spread them out into an even layer, and season with salt. Allow the shallots to drain, then carefully lift the top layer of paper towels and roll the shallots onto the second layer, blotting gently with the first. Repeat until the shallots are on the last layer of paper towels and mostly grease-​free. Allow the shallots and oil to cool to room temperature, then store separately in airtight containers and refrigerate.

small cucumber, halved lengthwise and cut into ½-inch slices

Large handful of roughly chopped mint leaves

Large handful of roughly chopped cilantro leaves
½
cup roughly crushed or chopped roasted peanuts","289 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the dressing: Combine garlic, chiles and sugar in the bowl of a large mortar and pestle. Pound into a fine paste. Add fish sauce and stir with the pestle until the sugar is fully dissolved. Add the lime juice and stir with the pestle to incorporate. Alternatively, you can combine the garlic, chiles, palm sugar (chop it into bits with a heavy knife or cleaver if it came in solid chunks), fish sauce and lime juice in a blender. Blend until the garlic and chiles are finely chopped, and stir until the sugar is dissolved.
Step 2
Prepare the salad: If using homemade shallots, skip to Step 3. If using store-bought shallots, toast them dry in a large skillet over medium-low heat until deep caramel brown and aromatic, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, you can toast the shallots on a sheet tray in an oven or toaster oven at 375 degrees until deep caramel brown, about 6 minutes). Season generously with salt and transfer to a bowl.
Step 3
Combine watermelon, onion, cucumber, mint, cilantro, peanuts, half of the fried shallots and ¼ cup dressing in a large bowl. Toss to combine. Taste and add more dressing as desired. (Excess dressing can be reserved in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks.) Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with remaining shallots. Serve.
Thai bird’s-eye chiles are small, bright and very hot. If you can’t find them, you can use any hot chile available to you, though, if possible, lean toward brighter, fruitier chiles like habanero or Fresno over grassier chiles like jalapeño or serrano. You can find palm sugar in most well-stocked Asian supermarkets or online retailers. (Pucks, paste or granulated all work fine here.) If you can’t find it, you can use light brown sugar in its place. You can find Southeast Asian-style fried shallots in most well-stocked Asian supermarkets, or from online specialty grocers. They can also be made at home.

tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Pinch of red-pepper flakes
1
tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves (optional)
1
tablespoon minced fresh chives (optional)","252 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
If using homemade shallots, skip to Step 2. If using store-bought shallots, toast them in a dry 12-inch skillet over medium heat until deep caramel brown and aromatic, about 3 minutes. Season generously with salt and transfer to a bowl.
Step 2
Smash the garlic cloves with the side of a knife and roughly mince. Set aside. Add a couple of inches of water and a large pinch of salt to the skillet, and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until just shy of al dente (about a minute less than the package directions).
Step 3
Meanwhile, combine ¼ cup oil, the minced garlic, red-pepper flakes and a large pinch of salt in a large saucepan or skillet. Heat, stirring frequently, over medium-low until the garlic is very aromatic and just starting to turn pale gold in parts, about 5 minutes. It should maintain a very gentle sizzle the whole time it is cooking (adjust heat as necessary). When the garlic is done, shut off the heat, then, using a ladle or spoon, add a large splash of the pasta water to the pan with oil to halt the cooking. Add half the toasted shallots and stir.
Step 4
When the pasta is just shy of al dente, using tongs, transfer it to the pan with the garlic oil, allowing any liquid that clings to it to come along; reserve a bit of the pasta water. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Return the pan with the pasta and garlic oil to high heat, and cook, stirring and tossing constantly, until a creamy, emulsified sauce coats the pasta. (If the sauce looks watery, continue tossing and cooking. If it looks broken and oily, add some more pasta water a few tablespoons at a time and continue cooking until it emulsifies.) Stir in the parsley and chives (if using), season to taste with more salt (it can take quite a bit of salt), transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with reserved toasted fried shallots and serve.
You can find Southeast Asian-style fried shallots in most well-stocked Asian supermarkets, or from online specialty grocers. They can also be made at home. Check the ingredients on the packaging. They should have only shallots and oil (some have starch or some other coating ingredients). Also look for relatively wide slices of shallot as opposed to crumbled bits.
Tip: For best results, use a high-quality bronze die-extruded pasta, such as De Cecco or Rustichella d’Abruzzo (look for dried pasta with a chalky, rough-looking surface as opposed to a smooth, darker yellow surface).

ounce finely grated Parmesan (about ½ cup), plus more for serving

Anchovies, left whole or torn into pieces (optional)","113 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the shallot aioli: Combine shallots, egg, lemon juice, mustard, fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce and garlic in the bottom of a jar just wide enough to fit the head of an immersion blender (see Tip). Add the neutral oil, pouring it in slowly so that it forms a distinct layer on top of the other ingredients. Place the head of an immersion blender all the way at the bottom of the jar. Turn on the blender and slowly pull it up through the jar so that the oil is slowly incorporated and forms a creamy emulsion.
Step 2
Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Whisk in the extra-virgin olive oil, then whisk in water as needed until the dressing forms a light, creamy consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 3
Prepare the salad: If using homemade shallots, skip to Step 4. If using store-bought shallots, toast the shallots in a large skillet over medium heat until deep caramel brown and aromatic, about 3 minutes. (Alternatively, you can toast the shallots on a sheet tray in an oven or toaster oven at 375 degrees until deep caramel brown, about 6 minutes.) Season generously with salt and transfer to a bowl.
Step 4
In a large bowl, toss the lettuce with a few tablespoons of the dressing, half of the fried shallots and the Parmesan until lightly coated. Taste some of it, then add more dressing and season to taste with salt and pepper as desired. Transfer to a serving bowl, sprinkle with remaining fried shallots, grate some more Parmesan on top, garnish with anchovies (if using) and serve. Leftover dressing can be stored in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can make this dressing in a regular blender by combining the shallots, egg, lemon juice, mustard, fish sauce, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic in the blender and blending into a fine paste. With the blender running, slowly drizzle the neutral oil into the mixture until an emulsion forms. Transfer to a bowl and continue with Step 2.
If you wish to use store-bought mayonnaise as the base for the aioli, skip the egg, lemon juice and both oils, blend together ¾ cup mayonnaise with the shallots, mustard, fish sauce, Worcestershire, garlic, salt and pepper.
You can find Southeast Asian-style fried shallots in most well-stocked Asian supermarkets, or from online specialty grocers. They can also be made at home.

In a medium bowl, whisk the brown sugar, oil, doenjang, mirin and vinegar until the sugar and doenjang dissolve. Season with salt and pepper. Add the salmon to the marinade and turn with your fingers to evenly coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 10 minutes and up to 8 hours.

Roast until the doenjang glaze bubbles like hot lava along the edges of the pan and the salmon is opaque but still slightly pink in the center, rotating the pan halfway through, 9 to 12 minutes. Divide the rice then the salmon among bowls and serve with kimchi, if desired.
You can find doenjang, often labeled “soybean paste,” in Korean or Asian supermarkets and online, either in jars or in plastic rectangular tubs. Funkily pungent and packed with savoriness, doenjang is a magical flavor booster that is sometimes compared to Japanese miso but has a saltier, more assertive kick. Full of fermented sourness and deep Parmesan-like umami, it can enliven all manner of soups, stews and salad dressings with unparalleled brio.

teaspoon finely grated lemon zest
1½
pounds stemmed strawberries (about 5 cups), sliced
3
tablespoons cornstarch

Small pinch of salt","513 user ratings","1 to 1½ hours, plus chilling and resting ","Step 1
Whisk the all-purpose flour and the almond flour in a large bowl, then set aside. (It’s best to stick it in the freezer for about 15 minutes until ready to use, to ensure a well-chilled dough.)
Step 2
Slice 3 tablespoons of the butter as thinly as possible without getting obsessive about it. (It’s OK if pieces break.) Cut the remaining 5 tablespoons of butter into ½-inch cubes. Keeping the sliced butter and cubed butter separate, set the butter in the fridge to chill until ready to use.
Step 3
In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix the ¼ cup yogurt with 1 tablespoon of the water and keep cold in the fridge until ready to use.
Step 4
Whisk the flour mixture with the 1 teaspoon sugar and the salt. Spread the cubed butter pieces over the flour and cut the butter into the flour using a pastry blender or your fingers until the chunks look slightly smaller than pea size. Toss the butter slices with the flour mixture, separating them as you go, then gently press them into the flour between your fingers into flat sheets. (This extra step is helpful in creating pockets of steam, which will make for a flakier crust, an added bonus for pie dough makers of any skill!)
Step 5
Drizzle the chilled yogurt over the flour and butter mixture. Use a spatula or a wooden spoon to toss and combine. If the dough seems dry, drizzle with 1 tablespoon of the ice water, and continue tossing and combining, incorporating any dry flour bits at the bottom of the bowl and scraping off the spatula as you go, until the mixture just comes together in a mound. If needed, drizzle more ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, without allowing the dough to get too wet.
Step 6
Transfer the dough to a large piece of plastic wrap, then press the dough into a 6-inch disk and wrap well. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.
Step 7
Heat oven to 400 degrees with the rack in the center position. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Step 8
Prepare the filling: Place ½ cup sugar and the lemon zest in a large bowl and rub the lemon zest into the sugar with your fingertips. Add the strawberries, cornstarch and salt; mix well to combine, making sure the cornstarch is well incorporated. Add up to another ¼ cup sugar if desired, depending on the sweetness of your strawberries and your desired level of sweetness.
Step 9
Dust your countertop with flour, then transfer the chilled dough to it and sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough. Roll the dough out to a 12- to 14-inch round, lightly flouring as needed. (It’s OK if the edges break and the shape isn’t perfectly round.) Gently transfer the dough by rolling it over a rolling pin and onto the prepared baking sheet. (At this point, if you’ve forgotten something, like preparing the egg wash, or if your dough has warmed up slightly, place the sheet pan in the fridge for a few minutes.)
Step 10
Mound the strawberries and their juices in the middle of the dough and leave a 2-inch border. Fold the border over the fruit, pleating as you fold and leaving the center of the galette exposed. Brush the crust with the egg wash and sprinkle with sugar.
Step 11
Bake until the crust is golden and the strawberries are bubbling, about 35 minutes. It’s OK if some juices leak. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour and serve.

For the Pork
1½
pounds pork tenderloin (see Tip)
¼
cup guava jelly or preserves (or other tangy fruit jam, such as mango, peach or apricot)
½
teaspoon fresh lemon juice","71 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Combine the ginger, scallions, garlic, salt and chiles (if using) in a food processor or blender and pulse until finely minced. Add the thyme, sugar, allspice, nutmeg, cayenne, cumin, coriander, lime juice and oil, then blend until the mixture becomes a fine paste.
Step 2
Using a clean towel or paper towels, pat the pork tenderloin dry. Using a sharp paring knife, cut a series of deep holes into the meat.
Step 3
Transfer the pork to a zip-top bag or container with a tight lid, and pour over the marinade. Let sit for at least 10 minutes on the countertop, or refrigerate overnight if possible. Bring to room temperature before continuing.
Step 4
When ready to cook, heat the oven to 400 degrees, adjusting your rack to the top third of the oven. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, then set a little water in a small pot and bring to a boil.
Step 5
Place the tenderloin in the center of the pan and put the pan on the center rack of the oven. Roast until the internal temperature is 145 degrees in the thickest part, flipping every 10 minutes, for about 25 minutes to evenly brown the outside.
Step 6
Mix the guava jelly and lemon juice with 1 tablespoon of the boiling water, and use a fork to break up then stir to form a glaze.
Step 7
Increase the oven heat to a high broil. Carefully pull the pan out of the oven, and brush the tenderloin with the glaze. Broil in the upper third of the oven 5 to 7 minutes, until it’s a toasty dark brown with some charred spots, brushing once more with any remaining glaze if desired.
Step 8
Remove the pan from the oven and set the tenderloin on a carving board to rest for about 5 minutes. Cut into slices and pour over any juices that remain.
Many commercially available pork tenderloins are sold in packs of two. This marinade is enough for 1½ pounds of tenderloin, so you can prepare both, leaving a little space between them in the oven, or freeze one for later. The raw marinated pork freezes very well, as the marinade more fully penetrates the meat.

(8-ounce) cans sprats in tomato sauce, or sardines in tomato sauce

Sourdough bread (preferably 20 percent whole wheat or rye) rubbed with garlic, for serving","106 user ratings","2 hours, plus at least 3 hours soaking","Step 1
Place the beans in a medium bowl and add enough water to cover by 4 inches. Let soak for at least 3 hours and up to overnight. Drain and rinse the beans. Fill a large pot or Dutch oven with 8 cups of water, add the soaked beans, bay leaves and salt, and bring to a boil over high. Reduce the heat and let simmer until the beans are tender, 30 minutes to 1½ hours, depending on soaking time and age of beans.
Step 2
While the beans cook, use the large holes of a box grater to shred the beet, then the carrot. Finely dice the onion and bell pepper. Cube the potatoes into medium pieces. Chop the dill. Shred the cabbage using a knife.
Step 3
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium. Add the shredded beets, sprinkle with the sugar and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes, then add the carrot and cook until tender, stirring occasionally, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and wipe out the pan.

large or 2 small wood chunks (such as oak, hickory or mesquite) or 1½ cups wood chips

Canola oil, for greasing the grill grate
1
tri-tip steak (about 2 to 2¼ pounds; see Tip)

Coarse kosher or sea salt

Freshly ground black pepper

Granulated onion or garlic (or both)","452 user ratings","45 to 55 minutes, plus lighting the grill","Step 1
If using wood chips, soak in water for 30 minutes. Set up your grill for indirect grilling and heat to 250 degrees. Clean and oil the grill grate.
Step 2
Remove the tri-tip from the refrigerator. Generously season it with salt, pepper and granulated onion or garlic (or both) on all sides.
Step 3
Place the tri-tip, fat side up, on the grill grate away from the heat. Insert a remote thermometer probe, if using, deep into the center of the meat. If you soaked wood chips, drain them. If using a charcoal grill, add the wood chunk(s) or chips to the coals. If using a gas grill, place the wood chunks under the grate over one of the burners, or place the chips in your grill’s smoker box. Close the lid. Indirect grill the tri-tip to obtain an internal temperature of 110 degrees, which will take 30 minutes or so. Transfer the tri-tip to a platter and let it rest for at least 10 minutes, or as long as 1 hour.
Step 4
Just before serving, heat your grill to high. On a charcoal grill, rake the coals into a mound in the center of the grill, adding fresh coals as needed. Let the new coals burn until glowing red. On a gas grill, simply set the burners on high.
Step 5
Return the tri-tip to the grate directly over the heat, fat side up, and reinsert the thermometer probe, if using. Direct grill until the top and bottom are sizzling, crusty and dark, and the internal temperature is 125 degrees for rare or 135 degrees for medium-rare, 3 to 6 minutes per side, turning with tongs.
Step 6
Transfer the tri-tip to a cutting board and thinly slice across the grain. (You do not need to rest the meat a second time.) Take time to notice the even color and doneness of the meat and to appreciate the intoxicating aroma of the wood smoke. Serve at once, while the steak is still hot.
Tri-tip, the triangular or boomerang-shaped steak cut from the tip of the sirloin, is also sold as Newport, Santa Maria, triangle and bottom sirloin tip. This technique also works with any thick steak, such as top round, sirloin or picanha or three-finger-thick porterhouses and tomahawks.

"Ryazhanka (Fermented Caramelized Milk)","Eastern European,Non Alcoholic Drinks,Dutch Oven,Kefir,Milk,Slow Cooker","Yield: About 7 cups","8
cups whole milk
3 to 4
tablespoons plain whole-milk kefir (see Tip) or sour cream","81 user ratings","3 days","Step 1
If using an oven, heat to 225 degrees. Place the milk in a Dutch oven (if baking the mixture) or large, heavy saucepan (if using a slow cooker) and bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring from time to time so the milk doesn’t scorch. It will take about 15 minutes to get to a simmer.
Step 2
Transfer to the oven, if using, and bake, uncovered, until the top is a deep caramel brown, about 6 hours. If using a slow cooker, transfer the milk to the slow cooker, cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours or on high for 4 to 6 hours, until the top is caramel brown. You can discard or save the skin that develops on top of the milk, refrigerating it in an airtight container. Traditionally, the skin is served on top of a glass of ryazhanka.
Step 3
Transfer the cooked milk directly to jars or first to liquid measuring cups to cool the milk and determine how much you have. Let cool at room temperature, uncovered, to 115 degrees. You do not want to add kefir to hot milk, as the heat will kill the bacteria. Add 1 tablespoon kefir for every 2 cups cooked milk. (You’d use 1 tablespoon kefir per pint jar, 2 tablespoons per quart jar, or 3½ tablespoons kefir total for 7 cups cooked milk.) Stir or whisk the kefir until fully incorporated. If the mixture isn’t already in jars, divide among jars. Cover the jars with coffee filters and secure around the tops with rubber bands or string.
Step 4
Leave the jars in a warm place until the ryazhanka develops a consistency that’s thicker than kefir but thinner than yogurt, 24 to 48 hours, depending on the temperature of your kitchen. You might see some separation between liquid and solids. The flavor will be both sweet and sour from the fermentation. Cover the jars with their lids and refrigerate until chilled. The ryazhanka can be refrigerated for up to 7 days.
Packed with probiotics, kefir is a fermented dairy product that is tart and tangy. Often likened to a drinkable yogurt, it can be found in the dairy section of most supermarkets.

Heat oven to 425 degrees and line sheet pan with parchment paper. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season all over with coriander, 1 teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
Step 2
Place onion wedges on the prepared sheet pan and lightly season with more salt and pepper. Add chicken and thyme sprigs to the pan and drizzle 3 tablespoons oil over everything. Toss until well coated, then spread chicken and onions in a single layer. Roast for 10 minutes.
Step 3
While the chicken is in the oven, combine rhubarb and 3 tablespoons honey in a medium bowl. Lightly drizzle with oil, add a pinch of salt and pepper, and toss until rhubarb is well coated.
Step 4
Remove chicken from oven and carefully spoon rhubarb onto the hot pan around the onions and chicken. Continue roasting until the chicken is cooked through, and the rhubarb and onion are tender and caramelized, 25 to 35 minutes longer, tossing the rhubarb and onions (not the chicken) once about halfway through.
Step 5
Stir the rhubarb and onions very well, making sure to incorporate all the browned bits and chicken juices from the bottom of the pan (this is the tastiest part). Then sample a piece of rhubarb. If it’s very tart, drizzle with a little more honey, tossing well. Serve chicken with rhubarb-onion mixture garnished with herbs.
You can substitute bone-in, skin on-breasts for the thighs and drumsticks. Just start checking 10 minutes earlier since white meat takes less time to cook than dark meat.

teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
1½
teaspoons salt

ounces plain kefir, plus more as needed
For the Dough
4
cups/510 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting (if needed)
1
teaspoon fine salt
1
cup/240 milliliters plus 1 tablespoon cold water

Peanut oil or refined sunflower oil, for frying (about 8 cups)","151 user ratings","4 hours ","Step 1
Make the meat filling: Place the chopped onion in a food processor and process until it is very fine and has started to release moisture. Transfer the onion to a large bowl. Add the beef, pork, black pepper and salt, and mix very well. Gradually add kefir to the mixture and mix it into the meat using a spoon. The consistency should be pourable and almost soupy, not stiff. If necessary, add more kefir, 1 tablespoon at a time, to achieve the desired consistency. Cover mixture and place it in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour.
Step 2
Make the dough: Place 3 cups of the flour in a large bowl. Add the fine salt and mix with a fork. Add the water and mix until combined. Sprinkle a work surface with some of the remaining flour and knead in the rest of the flour little by little (you may not need all of it), until the dough is pliable and not sticky, about 15 minutes. (The dough should spring back when you make a slight indent with your finger.) Shape the dough into a ball, place in a bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rest for at least 1 hour.
Step 3
Set up your frying station: Pour 2 inches of oil into a wok or a Dutch oven. Line a sheet pan with a wire rack and some paper towels to absorb any excess oil from the finished chebureki. Heat the oil over medium-high until the temperature reaches between 350 and 375 degrees.
Step 4
Divide the rested dough into 12 pieces and roll them into balls. (The dough should be pliable and shouldn’t need much flour.) Flatten the pieces into disks and cover with plastic wrap so they don’t dry out. Working with one piece at a time, lightly dust the counter with flour and roll out the dough into a very thin round about 8 inches in diameter. (You should be able to read text through the dough.)
Step 5
Place 3 level tablespoons of filling on one side of the round and spread it into a thin half-moon, leaving a 1-inch border around the filling. Make sure not to add too much filling! Overfilling increases the risk of leakage during frying.
Step 6
Fill a small bowl with water, and using your finger, dampen the edges of the whole round to help seal the cheburek. Fold the dough over the side with the filling, trying to make sure there are no air bubbles between the filling and the dough to help decrease the chance of bursting. Press the edges to seal tightly, then seal them completely with a fork. Use a pasta wheel or paring knife to trim off any uneven edges, if you like.
Step 7
Once the oil is at 350 degrees, carefully lower the shaped cheburek into the oil and fry until the dough is golden brown and bubbly, about 2 minutes per side. Using tongs or a large slotted spatula, transfer the fried cheburek to the rack. Repeat shaping, filling and frying with the remaining dough and filling.
Step 8
Let the cheburek cool slightly, then dig in! These are best eaten hot. Enjoy with a glass of ryazhanka or kefir.

Make the biscuits: Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Butter a small baking sheet. (Keep the cubed butter cold.)
Step 2
Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Add the cold butter and toss to coat, then cut the butter into the flour using a pastry cutter or rub and pinch it in with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse sand with no bits larger than the size of gravel.
Step 3
Add the milk all at once and quickly stir with a fork until the dough comes together in a shaggy mass. Use the fork to scoop and drop 4 even mounds of dough onto the prepared sheet, spacing apart. Gently pat the tops and sides to form round pucks; it’s OK if the tops are a little craggy.
Step 4
Bake until golden brown, 20 to 23 minutes. Let cool on the pan on a rack while preparing the fillings.
Step 5
Make the fillings: Beat the eggs in a medium bowl until well mixed but not frothy. Season very generously with salt and pepper and beat again. Heat a medium nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the butter, turn the heat to low and swirl the butter to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. When the butter has melted about halfway, add the eggs all at once. Cook, stirring gently, until mostly set but still a little wet, 1 to 2 minutes, then spread in an even layer.
Step 6
Once the bottom and edges are fully set, turn off the heat and cut the egg pancake in quarters using the spatula. Set a slice of cheese over each quarter. Slice each of the biscuits in half and spread jam on both halves. If you want bacon, sausage or ham, place them over the bottom halves. Slide the cheesy egg quarters over the bottom halves (or meat) and fold over any corners that stick out. Sandwich with the top halves and serve warm.

"Root Beer Rickey","Cocktails,Lime Juice,Whiskey,Spring,Summer","Yield: 1 drink","
Ice
2
ounces rye whiskey
1
ounce fresh lime juice (from 1 lime)
4
ounces root beer (see Tip)

Lime wedge, for serving (optional)","155 user ratings","4(155)","Step 1
Into an ice-filled Collins glass, pour the whiskey and lime juice. Top with root beer, then give a quick stir with a bar spoon, fork handle or chopstick. Top with the lime wedge, if using.
The flavor of the drink is largely dependent on the quality of the root beer, so it’s worth seeking out a root beer sweetened with honey, molasses or cane sugar as opposed to high-fructose corn syrup. Virgil’s and Jones Soda are great choices; Cicoria uses root beer from Crater Lake Soda.

"Salami Pasta Alla Gricia","Italian,Pastas,Pasta,Pecorino,Salami,Dinner,Weeknight,Main Course","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","
Kosher salt
1
pound tubed, curved or long pasta, such as rigatoni, orecchiette or spaghetti
1
tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1
(6-ounce) log mild or spicy salami, casing discarded and meat coarsely chopped
1
teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1
cup/2 ounces finely grated pecorino or Parmesan, plus more for serving","364 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 2 cups of the pasta water, then drain the pasta.
Step 2
While the pasta cooks, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the oil and salami over medium-low. Cook, stirring often, until crisp and golden-brown, 7 to 10 minutes. (Don’t be tempted to raise the heat, as you need the fat to fully render from the salami to form the sauce.) Remove from heat and stir in the black pepper until fragrant. Set aside until the pasta’s ready.
Step 3
Add 1½ cups pasta water to the salami and simmer over medium-low heat, shaking and stirring until the water emulsifies with the fat to create a homogeneous liquid, 2 to 4 minutes.
Step 4
Add the cooked pasta and pecorino, and cook, shaking the pot and stirring vigorously until the cheese is melted and the sauce glosses the noodles, 2 to 4 minutes. If the sauce is thin, keep simmering. If you can’t see the sauce in the bottom of the pot or on the noodles, add more pasta water and keep stirring over medium-low.
Step 5
Serve right away, with more pecorino on top.

"Fish Sticks With Peas","Finger Foods,Seafood,Bread Crumb,Fish,Pea,Dinner,Main Course,Spring","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","For the Fish Sticks
¼
cup all-purpose flour
½
teaspoon ground turmeric
¼
teaspoon onion powder
⅛
teaspoon garlic powder

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
2
large eggs
1
cup bread crumbs (regular or panko)
1½
pounds skinless cod fillet (about 1-inch thick)
¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed

Tartar sauce and lemon wedges, for serving
For the Peas
3
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
3
medium garlic cloves, finely grated
½
teaspoon grated lemon zest

Red-pepper flakes, to taste
1
pound frozen green peas

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
¼
cup roughly chopped mint leaves","320 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Prepare your dredging station and make the fish sticks: Place the flour, turmeric, onion powder, garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper on a large plate; stir to combine. In a pie plate or shallow bowl, beat the eggs with 1 tablespoon of water and sprinkle with a little salt. Place the bread crumbs and ¾ teaspoon salt on another large plate and stir to combine. Place a baking sheet beside you.
Step 2
Dry the fish well with paper towels. Season the fish with 1 teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper, then cut into 1½- to 2-inch strips. Dredge each piece of fish in the seasoned flour (shaking of any excess flour), then in the egg, then in the bread crumbs; place breaded fish pieces on the baking sheet.
Step 3
Pan-fry the fish sticks: In a large (12-inch) pan, heat the oil over medium-high. (To bake the fish sticks, see Tip.) When the oil is hot but not smoking, reduce the heat to medium and fry the fish sticks on all four sides until golden and crisped, about 4 minutes per side. You may need to do this in batches; add more oil if needed.
Step 4
While the fish fries, prepare the peas: In a large pan, heat the oil over medium-low. Add the garlic and cook, stirring continuously until fragrant, about 2 minutes, taking care not to burn it. Add the lemon zest and some red-pepper flakes, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add the peas and 1½ teaspoons salt, stir to combine, then cook for 1 minute in the lemony oil. Add ¼ cup water, increase the heat to medium and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the peas are tender but not mush and most of the water has been absorbed, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove from the heat and stir in the mint.
Step 5
Serve the fish sticks with the peas and tartar sauce, plus some lemon wedges to squeeze over the fish.
To bake, heat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Prepare the fish sticks as written. Use a cooking spray or lightly brush the breaded fish sticks with olive oil. Bake the fish sticks on one side for about 12 to 14 minutes, then flip and bake for an additional 12 to 14 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and the breading is crisp and golden brown.

"Lemon Bundt Cake","Bundt Cake,Freezer Friendly,Lemon,Make Ahead,Sour Cream,Sugar,Dessert","Yield: 12 servings","¾
cup/170 grams unsalted butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan
3

1
teaspoon baking powder
½
teaspoon baking soda
4
lemons (preferably organic or unwaxed), scrubbed and dried
2¼
cups/450 grams granulated sugar
¼
cup/60 milliliters neutral oil
5
large eggs, at room temperature
1
cup/230 grams sour cream, at room temperature
1
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or ½ teaspoon fine salt, plus more for the glaze
2
cups/200 grams sifted confectioners’ sugar","684 user ratings","1 hour 30 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees, and butter and flour a 12- to 15-cup Bundt pan. Make sure to apply a thin layer of butter and flour on every nook and cranny of the pan to ensure that the cake doesn’t stick.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and baking soda.
Step 3
Zest the lemons into the bowl of a stand mixer or large mixing bowl.
Step 4
Remove the remaining peel and pith from 3 of the lemons by cutting off the top and bottom tip of each lemon. Stand each lemon up on one end, and use a sharp paring knife to follow the curve of the fruit and cut the peel and white pith away; discard it. Chop the lemon flesh into small pieces and remove the seeds and any large pieces of membrane. Transfer the chopped lemons to a bowl if the juice is running off of the board. (You should have about ⅓ cup.) Set aside.
Step 5
Add the granulated sugar to the bowl with the zest and rub the mixture together with your fingers to release the oils in the zest. Add the softened butter and oil to the mixture, and mix on medium speed with the paddle attachment or using an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally to ensure even mixing.
Step 6
Add the sour cream and salt, and mix on medium speed until homogeneous. Add the lemon flesh and juices, and mix until well combined; the mixture may separate a bit, but don’t worry.
Step 7
Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until just combined. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure everything is well mixed and no pockets of flour remain.
Step 8
Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and tap the pan on the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles. Bake the cake for 50 to 60 minutes or until the cake is golden and puffed, and a toothpick inserted comes out with a few moist crumbs.
Step 9
Let the cake cool on a rack for 10 minutes. Then carefully turn it out onto a rack or serving plate to glaze and finish cooling.
Step 10
While the cake cools, make the glaze: Juice the remaining lemon. (You should have about 4 tablespoons.) Add the confectioners’ sugar, a pinch of salt and about three-quarters of the lemon juice to a bowl. Whisk until smooth, adding more lemon juice as necessary to make a thin but opaque glaze.
Step 11
Immediately brush a thin layer of glaze over the warm cake, and let the glaze set until the cake has cooled to almost room temperature. When the cake is mostly cool, brush the remaining glaze over the top. Cool, slice and serve. Store any leftovers covered at room temperature for up to 4 days; the glaze may get a bit sticky as it sits.

very ripe, blackened medium plantains (about 6 ounces each)

Neutral oil, such as vegetable or canola oil, for frying

Use a paring knife to cut a slit along the length of the plantains, carefully avoiding cutting into the flesh. Remove and discard peels. Slice plantains in half crosswise, then quarter each piece lengthwise into 4 wedges. (Each piece should be about the size of a chunky fry.)
Step 2
Pour about 1½ inch of neutral oil into a medium Dutch oven or high-sided cast-iron skillet and heat over medium. When the oil shimmers (it should be around 350 degrees), fry the plantains in batches until golden brown, flipping carefully with a slotted spoon, about 3 minutes and up to 6 minutes. (If any of the plantains stick to the bottom of the pot at first, release them carefully so they do not burn.) The plantains should be caramelized and slightly crisp at the edges but still tender in the middle.
Step 3
Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fries to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt to taste and repeat with remaining plantains. Serve immediately.

cup/125 grams natural creamy peanut butter
4
ounces/115 grams semisweet chocolate (preferably bar chocolate), roughly chopped

Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling","182 user ratings","20 minutes, plus 2 hours’ cooling","Step 1
Grease a 9-inch square pan with butter and sprinkle ½ cup/17 grams of the cornflakes on the bottom of the pan.
Step 2
In a large pot, melt the 6 tablespoons/85 grams butter over medium-low heat. Add the marshmallows and kosher salt, and cook, stirring often, until about half of the marshmallows have melted but the mixture is not completely smooth. Add the peanut butter and mix until just combined, keeping some lumps of marshmallow.
Step 3
Take the pan off the heat, and working quickly, add about half the remaining 5½ cups cornflakes, folding them into the marshmallow mixture as gently as possible to avoid crushing the cereal. Repeat with the remaining cornflakes. If the mixture becomes too sticky to work with, briefly return the pot to the heat on low.
Step 4
Working quickly, transfer the mixture to the prepared pan, using a wet spoon or spatula to spread and pat into an even layer, again being careful to avoid crushing or packing the cereal.
Step 5
Place the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl and microwave it in 15-second intervals, stirring between intervals, until melted and smooth. Drizzle the chocolate over the bars in overlapping lines. (If using chocolate chips, scatter the chips onto the surface of the bars while they are still warm and let sit for 5 minutes, allowing the heat of the cornflakes to melt the chocolate before dragging a fork or toothpick through it to create lines.) Sprinkle the bars lightly with flaky sea salt, and set aside at room temperature (in a cool spot, if possible) until completely set, about 2 hours.
Step 6
Cut into bars and serve. Bars will keep, wrapped well at room temperature, for up to 3 days.

teaspoon distilled white vinegar
¼
teaspoon ground mace
2
pounds/907 grams lump crab meat, drained if needed
½
cup/120 milliliters vegetable oil, plus more as needed","698 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Heat the broiler to 500 degrees (or its highest setting). On your oven’s highest rack, broil all the bread slices on a baking sheet for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden and crisp but not burned. Flip all the slices over and broil for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the broiler off and allow the bread to crisp in the oven until totally dry, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 2
Remove the bread from the oven and let cool. Using a box grater or rolling pin, coarsely grate and crush the bread slices into bread crumbs (or, pulse them in a food processor). The crumbs should look and feel like sand; you should get about 4 cups. Set the bread crumbs aside.
Step 3
In a large cast-iron skillet, melt the butter over high heat. Once the butter is melted, add the onion and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 minutes.
Step 4
Pour the butter and onion into a large bowl. Whisk the flour into the melted butter and onion, then slowly whisk in the milk to make a creamy sauce. Once the sauce is smooth, whisk in the eggs, lemon juice, vinegar and mace.
Step 5
Add the crab meat to the cream sauce and mix lightly with a fork; don’t break up the pieces of crab meat. Gently fold in just enough of the bread crumbs so that the mixture holds together (about 2½ cups). Divide the crab mixture into 12 equal portions, setting them on a baking sheet as you go. They should be thick rounds — about the size of the palm of your hand, and roughly 1½ inches thick.
Step 6
Using your hand, take a scoop of the toasted bread crumbs and coat each crab cake.
Step 7
Wipe out the skillet and heat the oil over high. Once the oil is hot, place a few of the crab cakes in the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until browned and cooked through. Place the cooked crab cakes on a paper towel to drain. Working in batches, cook the remaining crab cakes, adding more oil as needed.
Step 8
Serve crab cakes immediately, or set aside in a warm oven (see Tip) while you cook the remaining crab cakes.
If you don’t have self-rising flour, substitute ¼ cup all-purpose flour mixed with ¼ teaspoon baking powder and a pinch of salt.
To keep the crab cakes warm after cooking, heat the oven to 175 degrees (the warm setting). Place the crab cakes on a large baking sheet lined with a piece of foil and place them in the oven. At this temperature, the oven will keep them warm without drying them out.

If it looks dry, add another ½ cup water. Cover the pot once more, and continue to bake for another 20 to 30 minutes.
Step 3
When polenta is thick and creamy, stir in 2 to 4 of the tablespoons butter (depending on how buttery you like it) and the Parmesan. Taste and add more Parmesan and salt, if needed.
Step 4
As the polenta cooks, prepare the vegetables: In a large skillet, heat oil over medium. Add shallots and sauté until tender and golden, 4 to 6 minutes.
Step 5
Stir in garlic and cook for another minute or two, until fragrant and very lightly golden in spots. Add vermouth and cook until alcohol evaporates, about 2 to 3 minutes.
Step 6
Stir in asparagus and peas, and cook until vegetables are glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add stock, remaining 2 tablespoons butter and a large pinch of salt, and bring to a simmer. Cook until vegetables are tender and sauce thickens slightly, 2 to 8 minutes. (Thicker asparagus will take longer to soften.) Stir in the mint. Taste and add more salt, if needed.
Step 7
To serve, spoon polenta into bowls, top with vegetables and their sauce, and grind on lots of fresh pepper. Finish with shaved Parmesan.
If using instant polenta, cook it according to package instructions and start at Step 3.

"Roasted Salmon With Ginger-Lime Butter","Seafood,Butter,Ginger,Lime,Salmon,Dinner,Weeknight,Main Course,Spring","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","1
(1½ pound) wild salmon fillet, such as king or coho, at room temperature

Salt and pepper

teaspoon lime zest
1
teaspoon lemon zest
2
tablespoons lime juice
1
pound baby spinach

Lime wedges, for serving
½
cup thinly sliced scallions, green and white parts","296 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Lay the salmon on a rimmed baking sheet, and season with salt and pepper. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 2
Make the ginger-lime butter: In a small bowl, combine softened butter, ginger, lime zest, lemon zest and lime juice. Add salt and pepper to taste, and stir well to combine.
Step 3
Transfer salmon, uncovered, to the oven to cook for about 8 minutes. Check the salmon once or twice as it cooks. Depending on the thickness of the fish, it should be fully cooked when little white juices appear on the surface — moist and yielding with big flakes when probed. It may take 10 minutes for thick fillets.
Step 4
As the salmon cooks, put 2 tablespoons ginger-lime butter in a wide deep skillet or large pot over medium heat. When butter is melted, add spinach and a pinch of salt. Put on the lid and turn heat to medium-high. (You may need to add the spinach in batches.) After 2 minutes, remove lid and stir spinach to help it wilt. When all spinach is wilted, turn off the heat.
Step 5
Transfer salmon to a platter or divide among individual plates. Smear the remaining ginger-lime butter on the fish. Surround with wilted spinach and lime wedges, and top with scallions.

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place the potatoes on a sheet pan and add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, garlic or onion powder (if using), and about ½ teaspoon of salt. Season with black pepper and toss to coat. Place in the oven and roast for 25 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile make the dressing: Combine avocado, mayonnaise, dill, olive oil, lime juice, garlic, 1 jalapeño and salt in a blender or small food processor. Blend until completely smooth. Taste and if you want it spicier, add the second jalapeño.
Step 3
After 25 minutes, remove the potatoes from the oven and toss. Push the potatoes to one side of the sheet pan, and add the green beans to the other side. Drizzle with a little olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Return the sheet pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the beans are crisp-tender and the potatoes are golden on the outside and tender all the way through. Don’t overcook the beans; if the beans are done before the potatoes are ready, remove them from the sheet pan and return the potatoes to the oven.

tablespoons Dijon mustard
1½
pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or tenders

Freshly ground black pepper","714 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil. Add the panko and oil to the sheet pan, season with ½ teaspoon salt, then stir with a fork until evenly moistened. Shake into an even layer. Toast in the oven, stirring with the fork halfway through, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Pick up the parchment and use it to funnel the toasted panko into a shallow bowl or pie plate. Set aside to cool. (Reserve the lined sheet pan.)
Step 2
In a medium bowl, stir together the honey and mustard. Pat the chicken dry, then pound with a mallet or heavy skillet into an even thickness (about ⅓-inch thick). Slice lengthwise into 1-inch-thick strips. Cut any long strips in half crosswise. (If using chicken tenders, no need to pound or slice.) Season with salt and pepper, then add to the honey mustard and toss to combine.
Step 3
Working with one strip at a time and removing dripping honey mustard, add the chicken to the panko mixture and use your fingers to pack the panko onto all sides of the chicken. (To avoid a big mess, designate one wet hand for touching the chicken and one dry hand for pressing in the panko.) Transfer to the lined sheet pan and repeat.
Step 4
Transfer to the oven and bake, removing from the oven to flip halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and the panko is browned, 10 to 15 minutes.

Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet (preferably straight-sided) over medium-high heat. Add the zucchini and 1 teaspoon salt, and stir, then cook undisturbed in an even layer until one side is golden, about 4 minutes.

Stir in the asparagus, carrot and garlic, and cook, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the peas, scallions and ½ teaspoon salt, then add the red-pepper flakes, oregano and a generous amount of black pepper.

Add the white beans and the cream, lower the heat to medium, and let the cream come to a simmer. Simmer for about 1 minute.
Step 3
Turn off the heat and stir in the lemon juice, Parmesan and Dijon. Taste and season with more salt, pepper or lemon juice as needed. Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of warm water to the creamy beans to loosen as you like; the sauce will thicken as it cools. (You may need more water when you reheat any leftovers.) Serve in bowls topped with the nuts and a handful of basil leaves. Pass more Parmesan at the table.

"Grilled Broccoli and Lemon With Chile and Garlic","Salads And Dressings,Vegetables,Anchovy,Broccoli,Chile,Lemon,Side Dish","Yield: 4 servings","
Salt
2
small or medium broccoli with stalks (about 1 ½ pounds/700 grams)
7
tablespoons/103 milliliters olive oil, plus more for grilling
1
large Fresno chile, thinly sliced at an angle, seeds and all
6
garlic cloves, thinly sliced lengthways
5 to 6
anchovies packed in oil, drained
1
large lemon, cut into 8 thin rounds and seeded, the rest squeezed for 1 teaspoon juice
1½
tablespoons flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly chopped

Flaky sea salt, for serving","564 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large saucepan of well-salted water to a boil over medium-high. Keep a large bowl of ice water next to it. Meanwhile, trim the broccoli so 2 inches/5 centimeters of stalk remain attached. Cut the broccoli in half lengthwise, then cut each half lengthwise again to give you 4 wedges per head.
Step 2
Blanch the broccoli by adding it to the boiling water and cooking for 3½ minutes, until softened. The stalks should retain a nice bite. Use a pair of tongs to remove the wedges and plunge them straight into the ice water to stop them from cooking further. Once completely cool, drain and dry them well, then place in a large bowl.
Step 3
Meanwhile, add 6 tablespoons/89 milliliters of oil, the chiles and garlic to a small frying pan and place it over medium heat. Cook for 7 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the garlic is golden and the chiles start to become transparent. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the solids to a plate lined with paper towels and set aside to cool and crisp further.
Step 4
Add the anchovies to the pan and place over low heat. Cook gently, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until an anchovy is soft enough to be easily squashed with the back of a spoon. Set aside to cool completely.
Step 5
Place a large, well-greased grill pan over high heat and ventilate your kitchen well. (See Tip for outdoor grilling.) Toss the broccoli gently with 1½ teaspoons olive oil. Once the pan is very hot, grill the broccoli in 2 batches, turning so that all the flat sides have nice grill marks, 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer to a tray to cool down. Grill the lemon rounds for 1½ minutes per side, until nicely charred, then transfer to a chopping board. When cool enough to handle, finely chop the lemon (skin and all) and transfer to a small bowl along with the lemon juice, parsley and remaining 1½ teaspoons olive oil. Mix well and set aside.
Step 6
Once the broccoli has cooled, top with the anchovy oil mixture and toss gently to combine. Arrange on a large serving platter and top evenly with the charred lemon mixture. Lastly, sprinkle over the fried chile and garlic and the flaked salt.
You can grill the broccoli and lemon slices at the same time on an outdoor charcoal or gas grill heated to medium-high (450 degrees). Grill (covered if using a gas grill), turning occasionally, until charred, about 10 minutes for the broccoli and about 3 minutes for the lemon.

2
cod fillets (about 4 ounces each)
4
large peeled, tail-on shrimp (about ⅓ pound)

Finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, for garnish","655 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Toast the star anise by stirring frequently in a small skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Set aside.
Step 2
Make the marinara base: Add the onion, garlic cloves, bell pepper and olive oil to a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. (Or, finely chop the vegetables by hand, then add to the pot along with the oil.) Add the mixture to a large pot and cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until soft, translucent and light golden in places, about 5 minutes. Add the Bloody Mary mix, canned tomatoes and juices and tomato sauce. Get every last drop from the cans by swirling a splash of water into each one and tipping the remnants into the pot. Add the toasted star anise, oregano, basil, thyme, sugar and bay leaf, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, uncovered, for 1 hour, stirring often so the bottom of the pot doesn’t burn. (Makes 7½ cups; see Tip.)
Step 3
While sauce simmers, roast the garlic: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Slice the whole garlic heads in half crosswise. Divide garlic, cut-sides up, between two pieces of aluminum foil, large enough to wrap the garlic up like two presents. Drizzle with olive oil, then wrap tightly. Set the foil packets on a baking sheet and roast for 1 hour, until the garlic is light brown and tender all the way through.
Step 4
Make the garlic butter: Once cool enough to handle, squeeze the garlic cloves out, discarding the skins. (You should have about 1 cup of roasted garlic.) Add to a food processor along with the softened butter and pulse until smooth and creamy. Or, smash the garlic to a paste and mix with the softened butter. (Makes 1½ cups; see Tip.)
Step 5
Make the garlic bread: Heat oven to 400 degrees. Spread ½ cup garlic butter on the cut sides of bread and season with salt and pepper. Set the bread, buttered-sides up on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake until toasted and golden in spots, about 15 minutes. As soon as the garlic bread comes out of the oven, sprinkle it with dried oregano and the Parmesan. Cut into large pieces, then wrap the foil from the baking sheet around them to keep warm.
Step 6
While the bread bakes, make the cioppino: In a large Dutch oven or wide, heavy pot, add 4 cups of the marinara sauce, plus the clam juice, thyme sprigs and red-pepper flakes. Season generously with salt and pepper and heat over medium-high until simmering, about 5 minutes.
Step 7
Separate the legs and claws from the crab bodies. Once the sauce is simmering, gradually add the seafood, starting with the crab bodies. Cook for a couple minutes, then add the crab legs and claws to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes.
Step 8
Add the clams, nestling them into the sauce around the edges, like numbers on a clock, cover with a lid and cook for about 6 minutes. Give the mixture a stir then add the mussels, in the same fashion as the clams. Cover and cook for another 3 minutes. Once the clams start to open, add the fish, gently nestling it into the sauce, and set the shrimp right on top to let them steam gently. Add 2 tablespoons of the garlic butter, put the lid back on and simmer until the fish cooks through and the shrimp get plump, about 5 minutes.
Step 9
To serve, transfer the cioppino to a deep serving bowl, being careful not to break up the delicate cooked fish. Perch the crab legs and claws on top and sprinkle with parsley. Serve with warm garlic bread on the side.
This recipe makes 3½ cups extra marinara sauce, which means you can get a second meal out of it. Fish out the star anise and try shrimp alla marinara, cheesy bread with marinara or a simple spaghetti marinara. Or, make cioppino for a larger crowd, in a larger pot, using the whole marinara yield and doubling the clam juice and seafood. The recipe also makes extra roasted garlic butter — a gift! Spread it on a bagel, drizzle it over wilted greens, use it to dress some hot spaghetti and peas, or drop a spoonful into a bowl of soup.

Heat oven to 375 degrees with a rack in the upper third. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
Place strawberries in a bowl and cover with boiling water. Let sit until soft and pliable, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain, pat dry and coarsely chop.
Step 3
Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda in a large bowl and whisk to combine. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the butter into the bowl, then toss until mixture resembles oatmeal. Alternatively, pulse all the dry ingredients together in a food processor. Cube the butter, add to the processor, and pulse until the mixture looks like oatmeal. Transfer mixture to a large bowl.
Step 4
Add strawberries and toss well.
Step 5
In a small bowl, whisk together buttermilk and egg. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir until all the dry flour bits are incorporated, but the dough is still shaggy. Using your hands, knead and press the dough a few times while it’s still in the bowl until the dough just holds together.
Step 6
Dump the dough out onto the prepared sheet pan. Pat the dough into a round loaf about 8 inches in diameter. Using a sharp knife, deeply score the loaf into 8 wedges (but don’t cut all the way through). Brush the loaf all over with buttermilk and sprinkle generously with sugar.
Step 7
Bake until golden brown, 25 to 35 minutes. Let cool slightly. Cut or break into wedges and serve warm with butter and clotted cream.
If you can’t find dried strawberries, pitted dates will give you a similar texture and level of sweetness. But you can also substitute other dried fruit.

In a medium saucepan or pot, heat the oil over medium. Add the onion and garlic, and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and fragrant, about 5 to 7 minutes. Take care not to burn the garlic by reducing the heat slightly if necessary.
Step 3
Add the rice and sprinkle it with the salt and turmeric. Stir to combine, then cook the rice and spices in the oil for about 1 minute. Add the water, bring to a lively boil over high heat and then immediately cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook for about 15 minutes, until the water has been absorbed. Turn off the heat and allow the rice to continue steaming, covered, for another 10 minutes.
Step 4
Gently fluff with a fork or a slotted spatula, taking care not to break too many grains. Garnish with the cilantro, if using, and serve.

"Papadzules (Eggs and Asparagus in Tortillas With Pepita Sauce)","Mexican,Asparagus,Corn Tortilla,Egg,Brunch,Dinner,Main Course,Vegetarian","Yield: 4 servings","
Ice
10
large eggs
1
pound asparagus, woody ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces
8
corn tortillas, preferably blue corn
1¾
cups pepitas (raw pumpkin seeds)
3
scallions, root ends trimmed, chopped
2
garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed
2
jalapeños, stemmed and roughly chopped
⅓
cup cilantro leaves and tender stems
1
tablespoon fresh lime juice, plus more to taste

Kosher salt","173 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Fill a large bowl with ice and water. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Using a slotted spoon, carefully lower the eggs into the water. Cook, adjusting the heat to maintain a gentle boil, for 6½ minutes for jammy eggs with a soft and runny yolk (or longer for medium- or hard-boiled eggs). Transfer the eggs to the bowl of ice water and chill until just slightly warm, about 2 minutes. (Keep the water boiling.) Gently crack the eggs all over and peel, starting from the wider end, which contains the air pocket. That gap between egg and shell makes peeling easier. Cut the eggs into quarters. Set 8 quarters aside for serving.
Step 2
Add the asparagus to the same pot of boiling water and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain, transfer to a medium bowl and let sit until ready to assemble.
Step 3
Heat a tortilla in a small skillet over medium heat, turning once, until warm, about 1 minute. Wrap in a clean kitchen towel or foil. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, stacking and wrapping them in the towel.
Step 4
Reserve ¼ cup pepitas and ¼ cup scallions for garnish. Combine remaining pepitas, remaining scallions, the garlic, jalapeños, cilantro, lime juice, 3 cups water and salt (1 teaspoon coarse kosher salt or 2 teaspoons Diamond Crystal) in the jar of a blender. Purée until smooth and the consistency of heavy cream. Taste and season with salt and lime juice if necessary. Transfer to a medium bowl.
Step 5
Working one at a time and using tongs, dip a tortilla into the purée, turning to completely coat in sauce. Transfer to a baking sheet as you go.
Step 6
Arrange 4 egg quarters and a few pieces of asparagus down the center of each tortilla. Fold one side over, then roll up the tortilla. Place seam-side down on a plate. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, dividing among plates and spooning the remaining pepita purée over. Top with the reserved pepitas, scallions, egg quarters and any remaining asparagus.

teaspoon dried oregano
½
teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more for sprinkling
2
cups beef broth

Salt
10
corn tortillas
1
pound shredded Cheddar (5 cups)

½ cup finely diced white onion

Fresh parsley or cilantro, for garnish (optional)","959 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease a 9-by-13-inch shallow baking dish or pan or a very large cast-iron skillet.
Step 2
Add the oil and flour to a medium skillet. Set over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture (known as roux) turns a golden color, smells nutty and thickens, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 3
Add garlic, chile powder, cumin, oregano and black pepper to the roux. Whisk until smooth (some clumping from the garlic is fine), being careful to not let the spices burn, about 30 seconds.
Step 4
While whisking constantly, add beef broth ¼ cup at a time, whisking after each addition, until smooth. Reduce heat to low and simmer gently, whisking occasionally, for 10 minutes. Then remove from heat, and allow the gravy to rest for another 10 minutes. Taste the gravy and season with salt as needed for a savory sauce.
Step 5
Meanwhile, in another pan, lightly heat a tortilla over medium just until softened, about 30 seconds per side. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel or sheet of foil and wrap. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, stacking them in the towel or foil. Be careful of overcooking: You’re softening each tortilla to prevent them from cracking as they’re filled and folded.
Step 6
Fill a softened tortilla with about ⅓ cup of cheese. Roll shut and, with the seam side facing downward, place in the greased baking dish or skillet. Repeat until you’ve filled all of the tortillas, setting the rolls next to each other.
Step 7
Slowly pour the gravy over all of the tortillas to coat. Afterward, sprinkle the dish with the rest of the cheese and the diced onion.
Step 8
Bake until the gravy is bubbling and the cheese melted, 20 to 25 minutes.
Step 9
Garnish with parsley, if desired, alongside a sprinkle of salt and black pepper. Serve immediately.
You want ground dried chiles, not chili powder, which includes other spices and salt. The choice of mild, medium or hot chile powder is up to you, but avoid using chipotle chile powder, which can end up bitter.

"Crispy Hash Browns","Vegetables,Creme Fraiche,Potato,Brunch,Dinner,Side Dish,Vegetarian","Yield: 4 servings","For the Hash Browns
2
large russet potatoes

cup grated Parmesan

Heaping ½ teaspoon garlic powder

Heaping ½ teaspoon onion powder

Kosher salt
5
tablespoons canola oil, plus more if needed
3
tablespoons unsalted butter
4
fresh thyme sprigs
1
tablespoon thinly sliced chives
For the Herbed Crème Fraîche
⅓
cup crème fraîche
1
teaspoon chopped fresh dill
½
teaspoon finely grated fresh lemon zest (from ½ lemon)

Kosher salt","328 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the hash browns: Peel the potatoes, then use a box grater to shred them lengthwise into long strands, then place them immediately into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from oxidizing. Pour out the water, add a second round of cold water until the shredded potatoes are immersed, and let them sit for about 5 minutes.
Step 2
While the potatoes soak, prepare the crème fraîche: Add crème fraîche, dill and lemon zest to a medium bowl and whisk until aerated, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt; refrigerate until ready to serve.
Step 3
Strain the potatoes, then use a cheesecloth or towel to squeeze out any excess water (or tightly grip them by the fistful, squeezing any liquid into the sink), transferring potatoes to a large bowl. Season shredded potatoes with the Parmesan, garlic powder, onion powder and a generous amount of kosher salt. (If you notice a little excess water in your bowl, feel free to pour it out.) Mix until everything is incorporated and then shape the mixture into 8 patties, patting them firmly until compact.
Step 4
Once you have your hash browns shaped and ready, divide 3 tablespoons canola oil between 2 large nonstick or cast-iron pans and heat over medium. Gently add 4 hash browns to each pan, using a spatula to sculpt the edges of each hash brown so they’re rounded like hockey pucks. Cook, undisturbed, until golden-brown and crisp underneath, about 5 minutes, reducing the heat to medium-low if browning too quickly. Carefully flip the hash browns, adding about 1 tablespoon of oil to each pan (or more, if needed), and cook over medium until the second side is golden-brown, another 3 to 5 minutes, reducing the heat to medium-low if browning too quickly.
Step 5
Once the hash browns are golden on both sides, working with 1 pan at a time, add 1½ tablespoons butter and 2 thyme sprigs to the pan and cook over medium, tilting the pan slightly and using a spoon to baste the thyme-scented butter over the hash browns, about 1 minute.
Step 6
Turn heat off and transfer butter-basted hash browns to a paper towel-lined baking sheet to absorb any excess oil. Repeat basting step with the remaining hash browns, butter and thyme sprigs.
Step 7
Garnish with chives and serve with crème fraîche.

1
pound linguine, bucatini or spaghetti
2
cups whole milk
¼
cup doenjang (see Tip)
2
tablespoons mirin

Freshly ground black pepper
¼
cup unsalted butter

Grated Parmesan, for serving","390 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large, wide pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high. Cook the pasta until about 2 minutes shy of al dente (according to package instructions); it should still be a little uncooked in the center and will finish cooking in the sauce later. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, drain the pasta and return it to the empty pot. While the pasta is cooking, pour the milk into a large liquid measuring cup or medium bowl. Whisk in the doenjang, mirin and a generous crack of black pepper until the doenjang dissolves.
Step 2
To the pasta pot, add the butter, milk mixture and half of the pasta water. Bring to a simmer over high. Cook, stirring constantly and vigorously with a wooden spoon, until the sauce reduces and thickens significantly, coating the noodles like thin cream, 5 to 7 minutes. Taste and season with salt if needed.
Step 3
Divide among plates. Top with as much grated Parmesan as you’d like and another crack of black pepper. Serve immediately.
You can find doenjang, often labeled “soybean paste,” in Korean or Asian supermarkets and online, either in jars or in plastic rectangular tubs. Funkily pungent and packed with savoriness, doenjang is a magical flavor booster that is often compared to Japanese miso but has a saltier, more assertive kick. Even a mere tablespoon of this beloved Korean paste, full of fermented sourness and deep Parmesan-like umami, can enliven all manner of soups, stews and sauces with unparalleled brio.

In a large bowl, whisk together egg, chickpea flour, water, soy sauce and garlic. Add onion, cabbage, mushrooms and sesame seeds; season with 1 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Using your hands, massage the cabbage mixture to evenly coat with the chickpea batter. Cover and let the mixture sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Juices from the vegetables will leach out and make the batter slightly wetter.
Step 2
Divide the cabbage mixture into 6 portions (about 1½ cups each).
Step 3
Heat ¼ cup vegetable oil in a large cast-iron pan over medium-low heat. Cook 3 portions at a time, coaxing each patty together in the pan and compressing them with a flat spatula. Gently fry the patties, without disturbing them, until one side is golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Flip and cook the other side until the golden brown and the vegetables are cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the patties from the pan onto a wire rack. Add remaining ¼ cup oil to the pan and cook the remaining 3 portions.
Step 4
Place a slice of cheese on each cooked vegetable patty and allow the residual heat from the patties to melt the cheese. Serve sandwiched between buns, topping with mayonnaise, tomatoes, pickles and lettuce.

4
large egg whites

Pinch of salt
¾
cup/151 grams granulated sugar

chocolate sandwich cookies (113 grams), such as Oreos
For the Topping
2
cups/480 milliliters heavy whipping cream
2
tablespoons granulated sugar

Pinch of salt
5
chocolate sandwich cookies (57 grams), such as Oreos","620 user ratings","2 ¾ hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 250 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Step 2
Make the meringue: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, add the egg whites and salt. Whisk on medium speed until frothy, about 1 minute. While the machine is still going, slowly add the sugar in a narrow stream, then raise the speed to high. Whisk the egg whites until glossy, stiff peaks form, about 4 minutes. When you lift the whisk out of the bowl and turn it upside-down, a meringue mountain peak should form without flopping over.
Step 3
Coarsely crush or chop the 10 cookies and add to the meringue. Gently stir with a rubber spatula or large metal spoon until the cookies ripple throughout.
Step 4
Mound the meringue onto the center of the parchment-lined sheet pan and, using the spatula or spoon, gently form into a round that’s about 8 to 9 inches wide and 2 to 3 inches high. You can encourage this shape by repeating a circular motion that swirls the meringue and creates lovely waves so the surface doesn’t look smooth. When you’re happy with your disk, make one final circular motion in the center to create an indent, where you’ll pool the whipped cream later.
Step 5
Bake the meringue for 1½ hours, then turn off the oven, leaving the door shut, and let the meringue finish cooking in the residual heat until crisp and dry on the outside with a springy, marshmallowy interior (but it should not be wet), 15 to 30 minutes. Remove the meringue from the oven and let it sit on the counter to cool completely.
Step 6
While the meringue cools, make the topping: In a large, clean bowl or in the stand mixer (with a clean bowl), whisk together the heavy cream, sugar and salt until billowy soft peaks form. When you turn the whisk upside-down, a peak of cream should flop over slightly like a Santa hat.
Step 7
Pile the whipped cream on top of the cooled meringue, leaving a border, and top the cream with the 5 cookies, crushing them over the cream with your hands or chopping them and sprinkling them on top. Slice and serve the Pavlova like a cake.

Combine pancetta and oil in a large skillet and turn the heat to medium. Cook until fat has rendered and the pancetta is golden brown and crisp, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer pancetta to a paper towel-lined plate.
Step 2
Add butter to the skillet and let melt over medium heat. Stir in shallot and cook until translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add chard stems and garlic, and cook until fragrant and golden, 2 minutes.

Step 5
Add lemon zest and stir until well distributed. Stir in chard leaves and cook until softened, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes longer. If the risotto is too thick, stir in a little water or some more broth (do this until the level of creaminess pleases you; perfect risotto texture is subjective). Stir in Parmesan, then taste and add more salt, if needed.

Salt and black pepper
4
slices thick, soft sandwich bread, such as Texas toast, toasted, if desired
2
lettuce leaves, such as iceberg, romaine, green leaf or Bibb","680 user ratings","5 minutes","Step 1
Open the can of tuna, leaving the lid in place after opening it. Invert the whole can over the sink and press the lid into the tuna firmly to squeeze out as much excess water or oil as you can. (Be careful not to cut your fingers on any sharp edges). Transfer the tuna to a medium bowl.
Step 2
Wash your hands well, then grab the boiled egg and squeeze it through your fingers into the bowl with the tuna. Add the celery, olive oil, onion, herbs (if using), mayonnaise, relish (if using) and lemon juice. Using a fork, gently fold together all the ingredients, trying to leave the tuna in relatively large chunks. Grab a few chips and, using your hands, crumble them into the bowl. Season lightly with salt and pepper, and fold again to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning to taste — more salt, pepper and lemon juice if it tastes bland, and more olive oil or mayonnaise if it tastes dry.
Step 3
When ready for lunch, spread each slice of bread generously with mayonnaise. Place lettuce on each bottom slice of bread, then top each with half of the tuna salad mixture. Add a generous handful of potato chips on top of each (more than seems reasonable), then close the sandwiches. Press down firmly so the chips break and embed themselves into the tuna salad and the bread. Cut into triangles and serve with extra chips on the side.
You can use oil- or water-packed tuna here; as long as the tuna is well drained, either will work just fine. Save the expensive stuff for other recipes. This recipe calls for extra-virgin olive oil, but for a more classic flavor, omit the olive oil and use up to 4 tablespoons of mayonnaise instead. For the chips, Ruffles, Fritos or kettle-style chips work best (especially salt and vinegar flavor), but again, the ideal sandwich uses whatever chips you happen to enjoy or have on hand.

large bunches fresh dill (about 8.5 ounces), stems trimmed, finely chopped, or ¼ cup dried dill

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
3 to 4
large eggs","393 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Add the oil and garlic to a medium pot, then set it over medium-low heat. Cook the garlic, stirring often, until fragrant and cooked, taking care not to burn it, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the turmeric, stir and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the beans, dill, 1½ teaspoons salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Stir gently so the beans don’t break, and cook for about 3 minutes, just so the flavors meld and no longer taste raw.
Step 2
Increase the heat to medium-high, add enough water to cover the beans, about 2 cups (or more as needed, if you’re using cannellini beans, which absorb more liquid), and bring to a gentle boil. Partially cover with the lid barely ajar, reduce the heat to medium-low, and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until the beans are tender, but still maintain their shape (no mushy beans please), and the flavors have come to life, about 12 minutes.
Step 3
Taste the beans and liquid for salt and pepper, and adjust as needed. The stew should be juicy enough to serve over rice, but if it seems too liquidy, remove the lid and cook a little longer to reduce it, keeping in mind that the eggs will also thicken it up. Add a little more water if the stew is too thick.
Step 4
Increase the heat to medium and add the eggs one at a time. If poaching whole eggs, use 4 eggs and make individual wells in the stew before adding each egg. Cook, uncovered, until the whites set and the yolk is cooked to desired consistency, 3 to 5 minutes. (Alternately, you can stir the eggs in: Add 3 eggs, then run a spoon through each egg to break them apart and cook, slightly covered, until the eggs set, about 3 to 5 minutes.) Taste, add more water if the stew is too thick, adjust seasoning and serve.
Tip 1: Frozen double peeled fava beans can be found at Iranian and Middle Eastern markets, and online. If using frozen lima beans, use the same amount.
Tip 2: If using fresh favas: Use 3 pounds fresh fava beans in their pods. Remove the favas from their pod (the first thick layer) as you would to shell fresh green peas. Once podded, bring a small pot of water to a boil and prepare an ice bath. Place the podded beans in the boiling water for a quick minute or two, then drain and dunk in the ice bath. Drain and easily pop the skin off by giving the bean a squeeze.

tablespoons lemon juice, plus more to taste
2 to 3
large red rhubarb stalks (about 8 ounces), cut diagonally into 1-inch pieces

Cooked rice, for serving","473 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Bring a few tablespoons of water to a boil in a small pot. Let the boiling water stand for 2 minutes to allow the temperature to drop slightly while you grind the saffron. Using a mortar and pestle (or a small bowl and the handle of a wooden spoon), grind a pinch of sugar with the saffron to a fine powder (you should have about ¼ teaspoon total). Add 2 tablespoons of the hot water, gently stir, cover and let steep until ready to use.
Step 2
In a large pan, heat ¼ cup of olive oil over medium. Add the parsley and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant and slightly darkened, about 8 minutes. Drizzle in more oil if the pan seems too dry. Add the mint and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Keep in mind that mint burns very quickly. Remove from the heat and set aside until ready to use. (You’ll reuse this pan.)
Step 3
In a large, deep sauté pan with a lid, or a Dutch oven, heat ¼ cup of the olive oil over medium-high. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with a little salt, and reduce the heat to medium. Add the turmeric, stir and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the beans, season well with salt and pepper, and cook, gently stirring without breaking the beans, until the flavors have mingled, about 5 minutes. Taste a bean and make sure it’s salted to your liking. The turmeric might feel overpowering at this point, but it will mellow as the stew simmers.
Step 4
To the beans, add the parsley and mint mixture (keeping the pan handy), 2 cups water and half of the saffron water, and season with salt. Gently stir and bring to a rapid simmer. Partly cover, reduce the heat to low and simmer, occasionally stirring, for 30 minutes, until the flavors have mingled and the oil rises.
Step 5
Add the rest of the saffron water, the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon sugar. Stir and simmer, partly covered, for 15 minutes. Taste as the stew simmers and season as needed. Add more water to the stew if necessary to make it juicier, or remove the lid to reduce the liquid. There should be plenty of liquid to spoon over rice, but it shouldn’t be soupy. The stew can be made 1 day in advance up to this point.
Step 6
Meanwhile, wipe clean the reserved pan from the herbs. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan and heat over medium. Add the rhubarb and cook until the color deepens on each side, about 2 minutes per side. You’re not fully cooking the rhubarb here; it should maintain its shape and still have a slight bite to it, as it will finish cooking in the stew.
Step 7
Gently place the rhubarb pieces in the stew, increase the heat to medium-low and cook, partly covered, until the rhubarb is tender and releases its tangy flavor, about 10 minutes. Don’t stir the rhubarb; you want it to maintain its shape and not turn mushy. Taste the stew as it simmers; add more lemon juice for extra acidity, if needed, and more sugar for balance, if you like. Serve over rice.
You can pulse the herbs in a food processor in batches to quickly chop them.

"Escovitch Fish","Caribbean,Seafood,Fish,Scotch Bonnet Chile,Vinegar,Main Course","Yield: 6 servings","For the Fish
2
pounds skin-on fish fillets from any light, sweet white-fleshed fish, such as black bass (see Tip), ½ to 1-inch thick
½
lime or lemon
1¼
teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste
1
teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste
1
teaspoon garlic powder
1
teaspoon onion powder
1
teaspoon ground allspice or 5 whole allspice berries (see Tip)
1
cup all-purpose flour

Canola or other neutral oil, for frying
2 to 3
garlic cloves, crushed
1 to 2
whole Scotch bonnet chiles or habaneros, depending on desired heat
For Topping and Serving
1
medium sweet onion, thinly sliced
1
large carrot, cut into thin 2-inch-long matchsticks
1
small chayote, peeled, halved, seeded and thinly sliced lengthwise
1 to 2
Scotch bonnet chiles or habaneros, seeded (depending on desired heat) and sliced
2
teaspoons whole allspice berries (optional; see Tip)
½
cup distilled white vinegar
1
tablespoon golden raisins, chopped (optional)

Good, crusty bread, such as sourdough or ciabatta","173 user ratings","30 minutes, plus resting","Step 1
Make the fish: Set the fish on a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Rub the cut lime all over the fish. Let the fish drain on the paper towels, then pat thoroughly dry.
Step 2
In a small bowl, combine the salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and ground allspice, if using. Take two-thirds of this seasoning and rub it all over the fish. If using thicker fillets, cut small slits on both sides and rub the seasoning into the slits. In a shallow dish, mix the remaining seasoning with the flour for dusting the fish later.
Step 3
Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add ½ inch of oil, just enough to fry one side of the fish at a time. (The fish should not be submerged in oil.) Add the garlic to the skillet, along with the chiles and whole allspice berries, if using.
Step 4
Lightly coat the fish on both sides with the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. When the oil is hot, carefully lay the fish in the pan skin side down, making sure to leave space between the fillets and working in batches if needed. Let cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then turn the fish over and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until the skin is crispy. The fish should be cooked only about 80 percent of the way through, as the residual heat will continue to cook it after it’s removed from the pan.
Step 5
Set the cooked fish skin side up in a large rimmed dish that can fit all the fish without any overlap. Keep the dish close to the stove.
Step 6
Make the topping: Pour all the oil and solids in the skillet into a bowl or measuring cup. Add 1 tablespoon of that oil to the skillet (discard the rest) and heat over medium-low. Add the onion, carrot, chayote, Scotch bonnets and allspice berries, if using. Cook, stirring often, for 2 to 3 minutes. Don’t let the vegetables get too soft; they should still have a little bite to them.
Step 7
Raise the heat to high, and add the vinegar and chopped raisins, if using. Working quickly before the vinegar reduces completely, swirl the pan to tumble together the ingredients and then carefully pour the hot bubbling mixture evenly over the fish. It should not swamp the fish, but reach only about a quarter of the way up the sides. Immediately and tightly cover the dish with foil.
Step 8
Leave the dish on the counter out of direct sunlight for at least an hour or up to 12 hours, so the fish has time to absorb all the flavors. (It gets better the longer it sits.) Do not refrigerate before serving: The fish is meant to be eaten at room temperature. Serve with the bread for mopping up the sauce. Leftovers may be refrigerated overnight and gently reheated in a pan over low heat to loosen the sauce.
• In Jamaica, whole snapper is traditional for this recipe, and parrotfish and kingfish are also popular, but you can use almost any white, mildly sweet fish fillets — the fresher, the better.
• Whole allspice berries add a deeper flavor than ground allspice, but they aren’t meant to be eaten. (Jamaican diners learn from an early age to avoid biting into them.) They may be removed from the finished dish before serving or eliminated entirely in favor of ground allspice.

cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for serving
1
pound curly pasta, such as casarecce or fusilli
2
cups (10 ounces) frozen peas","365 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. In a small or medium skillet over medium, toast nuts, shaking the skillet occasionally until browned (try one to see), 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board to cool.
Step 2
As the nuts cool, into a large bowl, grate the Parmesan on the small holes of a box grater (or pulse chunks in a blender).
Step 3
Add the garlic clove and a pinch of salt to the pile of nuts and coarsely chop the nuts and garlic together. Add a handful of the herbs and another pinch of salt, and coarsely chop. (Opt for forceful, purposeful chops as opposed to soft, timid ones.) Toss and smash the mixture every few chops. Repeat with the remaining herbs, salting at each step, until a wet, coarse paste forms. Stir into the cheese, then stir in the olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 4
Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente. In the last 3 minutes of cooking, add the peas to the pasta. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain. Add the pasta and peas to the pesto and stir to combine. Add pasta water as needed to loosen the sauce. Season to taste with salt, pepper, more oil and more Parmesan.

teaspoons cornstarch
2
cups/10 ounces dark, seedless grapes, plus more for serving
2
teaspoons agave (optional)

Vanilla ice cream and fresh tarragon leaves, for serving","245 user ratings","30 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Prepare dry dumpling ingredients: Sift all dry ingredients into a medium bowl. Use a fork or whisk to blend thoroughly. Dump the contents of the bowl onto a flat, clean workspace. Using your hands, make a round mound at least 1 ½ inches tall, then use fingers to clear a hole in the middle. It should go all the way down to the surface to accommodate all of the wet ingredients.
Step 2
Combine wet dumpling ingredients: In a small bowl, whisk together grape juice, egg, melted butter and agave, if using. Pour the mixture into the well of the dry ingredients.
Step 3
Blend dough: Using a fork, gradually fold the dry mixture along the perimeter of the well into the wet mixture in the center, stirring to integrate. Do not overmix. When combined, use your hands to form a ball.
Step 4
Roll out dough: Sprinkle a small amount of flour onto a dry, clean work surface. Use your hand to spread the flour into a 12-by-12-inch square. Roll the ball of dough into the flour, coating all sides. Generously sprinkle additional flour onto the workspace and slowly mash the ball with your hand. Use a floured rolling pin to flatten dough into a large rectangle approximately ¼-inch thick and 8-by-12 inches wide, dusting the pin with flour as needed to prevent sticking.
Step 5
Cut dumplings: Using a dry knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into strips to make 1-inch squares. Using a fork, prick each square in three parallel lines, all the way to the work surface. This will help aerate the dough to absorb the grape juice as it simmers.
Step 6
Make the sauce: Pour 4 cups well-shaken grape juice into a wide, high-sided skillet and turn heat to medium. Dissolve cornstarch in 2 tablespoons of cold water before whisking into grape juice. Add grapes and agave, if desired. Bring to a rolling boil over medium heat.
Step 7
Cook the dumplings: Using a rubber spatula, carefully add dumplings to boiling juice until skillet is full but not crowded. Stir the dumplings to immerse; the dumplings may touch, but not stack. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Check for overcrowding after 5 minutes, removing extra dumplings if needed. (Discard any remaining uncooked dumplings, or simmer in additional grape juice, if desired.)
Step 8
Thicken sauce: Uncover simmering dumplings and keep temperature at medium-low. Cook for 5 minutes until the sauce thickens but does not bubble. It should be the consistency of a thick syrup. Remove from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
Step 9
Spoon mixture over vanilla ice cream and garnish with fresh grapes and tarragon.
Bottled grape juice tends to settle, so shake thoroughly before using.

ounces cottage cheese (heaping ¾ cup)
½
cup grated Parmesan (2 ounces)

cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese (4 ounces)","1713 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Boil a kettle of water (an electric kettle works great here).
Step 2
Meanwhile, heat a medium saucepan over medium-high. Add the olive oil and artichoke hearts and cook, stirring occasionally, until the artichoke hearts fall apart, become jammy and start to brown at the edges, 10 to 15 minutes. Add the spinach, season with salt and pepper, and stir until considerably wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and return the saucepan to the stove (no need to wash it out).
Step 3
Make the béchamel sauce: In the saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook, whisking constantly until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Still whisking constantly, slowly add the half-and-half. Raise the heat to high and bring to a simmer, whisking all the while, then immediately reduce the heat to continue simmering, now whisking occasionally, until the sauce thickens to the consistency of gravy, 10 to 20 minutes. Season generously with salt, pepper and nutmeg.
Step 4
Add half of the béchamel to the bowl with the artichokes. Stir to combine and cool slightly, for about 15 minutes. While the mixture cools, place the lasagna noodles in a large high-sided pan or dish, pour over the recently boiled water from the kettle and let soak until the noodles are softened but not soggy, about 15 minutes. Add the cottage cheese, Parmesan and egg to the artichoke mixture, season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.
Step 5
Assemble the lasagna: In an 8-inch square baking pan or dish, add enough béchamel to thinly coat the bottom. Put down a single layer of lasagna noodles, about 3 noodles, letting the ends rise up the edges of the pan. Spread half of the artichoke mixture evenly over the noodles. Turn the pan 90 degrees and put down another layer of lasagna noodles, again pressing the ends up against the edges of the pan. Spread half of the béchamel evenly over the noodles. Repeat these layers once more with the remaining lasagna noodles, artichoke mixture and béchamel, ending with the béchamel. Evenly sprinkle the mozzarella on top. (At this point, you can cover the lasagna and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours if not baking right away.)
Step 6
Bake the lasagna until the sauce is bubbling at the edges (especially in the corners of the pan), and the mozzarella and the exposed ends of the noodles are golden brown and crispy, 15 to 20 minutes. (Add more time if baking directly from the refrigerator.) Let cool for at least 30 minutes before slicing so that slices won’t collapse when transferred to plates.

In a small serving bowl, combine the mayonnaise and soy sauce. Season with the juice of 1 lime wedge and salt as needed.
Step 2
In a medium mixing bowl, use a fork to mash and thoroughly combine the chopped cilantro, mashed avocado, scallions, garlic, ginger, red-pepper flakes, 1 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon of the soy-lime mayonnaise. Add the chicken and gently combine. Form into 4 large balls.
Step 3
Heat a large (12-inch) cast-iron or heavy skillet over medium heat until very hot, 1½ to 2 minutes. Add the neutral oil or ghee, then add the chicken meatballs, spacing them out in the pan. Use a metal spatula to press them until they form ½-inch-thick patties. Cook without moving for 3½ to 4 minutes, until a deep golden crust has formed and they easily release from the pan. Flip the patties using the spatula and cook until done with a nice crust on the other side, about 3 minutes more. If the patties need more time, cover the pan and cook for 1 to 2 more minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to avoid scorching.
Step 4
Squeeze a lime wedge over the patties and serve sandwiched between the buns topped with lettuce, a healthy slathering of the lime-mayonnaise, avocado slices, jalapeño slices if using, and cilantro sprigs, if desired. Serve with the remaining lime wedges and mayonnaise on the side.
Resist the urge to add more than ¼ cup mashed avocado to the ground chicken, as the burgers will get too soft and fall apart during cooking.

Combine the cilantro, garlic, chile, 2 tablespoons oil, ginger, lime juice, turmeric, garam masala, cumin, coriander, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt in a blender. Purée, using a wooden spoon or the blender wand to help combine ingredients if necessary. Scrape the puréed mixture into a bowl. Add the shrimp and use your hands or a spatula to evenly combine. Marinate for up to 1 hour in the refrigerator, if possible, or proceed immediately to Step 2.
Step 2
Dredge the shrimp: Pour the farina onto a lipped plate or into a large shallow bowl and season with two generous pinches of salt; toss to combine. Let the marinade cling to the shrimp, then dredge the shrimp in the farina, patting the farina onto each shrimp to adhere, and carefully shaking off any excess crumbs. Place the dredged shrimp on a parchment- or foil-lined sheet pan.
Step 3
Heat ¼ cup of the oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Working in 2 or 3 batches, depending on the size of your pan and the size of your shrimp, lay the shrimp in the pan in one layer and fry without disturbing until the shrimp are deeply golden brown on one side, about 3 to 4 minutes. Gently flip with tongs or a spatula and fry until golden brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the shrimp to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. (If any large shards of coating come off the shrimp, remove them from the oil, and serve with the shrimp.) Wipe the skillet clean of crumbs with a paper towel and add more oil to the pan as necessary to maintain the amount, and repeat the pan-frying process with the remaining shrimp. Serve with lime wedges on the side.

"Browned-Butter Rhubarb Crisp","Pies And Tarts,Almond,Brown Butter,Butter,Rhubarb,Dessert,Spring","Yield: 8 servings","For the Crisp Topping
½
cup plus 2 tablespoons/141 grams unsalted butter
1¼
cups/160 grams all-purpose flour
½
cup/100 grams light brown sugar
½
cup/55 grams sliced almonds
½
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or ¼ teaspoon fine salt
For the Rhubarb
2
pounds rhubarb, chopped into 1-inch pieces (8 cups)
½
cup plus 2 tablespoons/113 grams granulated sugar
2
tablespoons all-purpose flour
2
teaspoons vanilla paste or extract
½
teaspoon finely grated orange zest

Pinch of kosher salt

Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream, to serve","148 user ratings","1 hour 20 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Meanwhile, brown the butter: Melt ½ cup/113 grams of the butter in a small skillet set over medium heat. (Use a skillet with a light interior so you can easily see the milk solids change color.) Cook the butter, stirring occasionally and scraping the milk solids off the bottom and sides of the pan as needed, until the milk solids turn golden brown and smell toasty, a few minutes. Transfer the butter to a medium heatproof bowl. Cut the remaining butter into 2 pieces and add it to the bowl with the hot butter. Stir occasionally until all the butter melts.
Step 2
Add the flour, brown sugar, almonds and salt to the butter, and stir together until evenly combined and clumps form. You may need to use your fingers to do the last bit of mixing.
Step 3
Prepare the rhubarb: In a 9-by-9-inch (or 9-inch round) baking dish, combine the rhubarb, granulated sugar, flour, vanilla paste, orange zest and a pinch of salt. Stir until combined and evenly mixed. Press the rhubarb gently into the pan, then scatter the crumble evenly over the top.
Step 4
Bake until the topping is deep golden brown and the rhubarb juices are bubbling, 55 to 65 minutes. Cool slightly, then serve warm with ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream. Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days. The topping will soften as it sits.

tablespoon neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola
1
yellow onion, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
3
medium Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
3
medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
6
cups vegetarian dashi (see Tip) or vegetable stock
2
teaspoons soy sauce or tamari
1
teaspoon granulated sugar
4
handfuls baby spinach leaves (about 5 ounces)
For the Curry Roux
6
tablespoons unsalted butter
⅓
cup all-purpose flour
2
tablespoons Japanese curry powder (such as S&B)
1
tablespoon garam masala
½
teaspoon ground cayenne","519 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, add the udon and cook for about 2 minutes, using wooden chopsticks or tongs to gently loosen the noodles from their tight bundle. Drain, rinse with cold water and leave to continue draining while you prepare the remaining ingredients. Keep the pot out for making the curry broth. (No need to rinse.)
Step 2
To make the curry roux, place a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter and allow it to melt completely. Add the flour and whisk until smooth. Cook, whisking constantly, for 4 to 5 minutes, until the roux turns a light caramel color. Whisk in the curry powder, garam masala and ground cayenne. Remove from the heat and set aside.
Step 3
Place the large pot from Step 1 over medium-high heat and add the neutral oil. Add the onion and stir for 1 to 2 minutes until slightly softened and fragrant. Add the potatoes and carrots, and stir. Pour in the dashi or stock, soy sauce or tamari, sugar and ½ teaspoon of salt, and stir to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium, cover and simmer for 10 to 12 minutes, until the vegetables are just tender.
Step 4
When the vegetables are tender, add the curry roux (if you are using store-bought curry bricks, add them now, checking package instructions to determine how many bricks to add) and stir until the broth thickens. It should be the consistency of a thick soup broth (like chowder). If it is too thick, add some water to loosen.
Step 5
Add the udon to the broth, along with the spinach. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the noodles are just warmed through and the spinach is just wilted.
Step 6
Divide the noodles and broth equally among four serving bowls, and eat immediately.
To make a vegetarian kombu dashi, place ½ ounce dried kombu (also labeled edible kelp or dasima) and 6 cups water in a pot, and heat on medium-low until it reaches a very low simmer. Remove from heat and remove the kombu from the liquid.

4
(4- to 6-ounce) salmon fillets, at least ¾-inch thick","781 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
In a medium serving bowl, toss together the herbs, scallions, red-pepper flakes, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Season with more lemon or oil as needed until the leaves look glossy. Set aside.
Step 2
Heat the broiler with a rack 6 inches from the heat source.
Step 3
In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce and mustard until smooth. Add the asparagus to a large sheet pan, toss with the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, then season well with salt and pepper. Move the asparagus to the sides, and place the salmon skin side down in the center. Season the salmon with salt and pepper, brush the tops and sides with the soy mixture, then toss the asparagus in the rest of the soy mixture. (Use a paper towel to wipe off excess soy on the sheet pan, as it will smoke.)
Step 4
Broil until the salmon is opaque with a deep brown crust, about 6 to 8 minutes for medium rare, and 8 to 10 minutes for medium, depending on the strength of your broiler and the thickness of the salmon. (Reduce cooking time by 1 to 2 minutes for thinner fillets.) If it looks like it’s browning too quickly or smoking excessively, move to a lower rack to finish cooking. Top the salmon and asparagus with the herb salad or serve on the side with a final round of pepper.

1½
cups/192 grams all-purpose flour
1
cup/124 grams confectioners’ sugar
½
cup/8 grams freeze-dried strawberries","1002 user ratings","2¼ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon chamomile to a large mixing bowl. Pour the hot melted butter over the chamomile and stir. Set aside to steep and cool completely, about 1 hour.
Step 2
Use the same saucepan (without washing it out) to bring the milk to a simmer over medium-high heat, keeping watch so it doesn’t boil over. Remove from the heat, and stir the remaining 1 tablespoon chamomile into the hot milk. Set aside to steep and cool completely, about 1 hour.
Step 3
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with the nonstick cooking spray and line with parchment paper so the long sides of the pan have a couple of inches of overhang to make lifting the finished cake out easier.
Step 4
Add the sugar and salt to the bowl with the butter, and whisk until smooth and thick, about 1 minute. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, vigorously whisking to combine after each addition. Zest the lemon into the bowl; add the baking powder and vanilla, and whisk until incorporated. Add the flour and stream in the milk mixture while whisking continuously until no streaks of flour remain.
Step 5
Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake until a skewer or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean (a few crumbs are OK, but you should see no wet batter), 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pan on a rack for 30 minutes.
Step 6
While the cake cools, make the icing: Into a medium bowl, squeeze 2 tablespoons juice from the zested lemon, then add the confectioners’ sugar. Place the dehydrated strawberries in a fine-mesh sieve set over the bowl and, using your fingers, crush the brittle berries and press the red-pink powder through the sieve and into the sugar. (The more you do this, the redder your icing will be.) Whisk until smooth.
Step 7
If needed, run a knife along the edges of the cake to release it from the pan. Holding the 2 sides of overhanging parchment, lift the cake out and place it on a plate, cake stand or cutting board. Discard the parchment. Pour the icing over the cake, using a spoon to push the icing to the edges of the cake to encourage the icing to drip down the sides dramatically. Cool the cake completely and let the icing set.

4
thick fillets white fish, such as cod or halibut (about 1½ pounds total)

Salt and freshly ground black pepper
3
medium leeks, trimmed, white and light green parts halved lengthwise and rinsed well

Extra-virgin olive oil
For the Olive Salsa Verde
1
lemon
½
cup coarsely chopped pitted Castelvetrano olives
½
cup chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
1
garlic clove, finely grated, minced or pushed through a garlic press

Large pinch of red-pepper flakes, or to taste

Fine sea or table salt
⅓
cup extra-virgin olive oil","280 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 425 degrees. Season fish all over with salt and pepper, and set aside while you prepare the leeks.
Step 2
Cut the leeks into matchsticks: Place a leek half, flat side down, on a cutting board and cut it in half crosswise. Then slice the pieces lengthwise into thin (¼-inch-thick) matchsticks. Repeat with remaining leeks.
Step 3
Spread leeks out on a rimmed baking sheet. Lightly drizzle them with oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, and toss to coat. Push aside the leeks to create 4 spaces in the center of the sheet pan just large enough for the fish fillets, then place the fillets in those cleared spaces. (Avoid putting the fish on top of the leeks, which won’t cook as well if they’re covered.)
Step 4
Drizzle fish with oil. Roast until the fish is opaque and just cooked through but not yet flaky, about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of fish. The leeks surrounding the fish will be soft and silky, while those at the edges of the pan may turn delightfully brown and crisp in spots. If the fish is done but you think the leeks need a little more time, transfer the fish to a serving platter, tent with foil to keep warm, and continue to cook the leeks for another few minutes.
Step 5
While the fish is in the oven, make the salsa verde: Using a fine rasp grater, grate ½ teaspoon lemon zest into a small bowl. Halve the lemon and squeeze in 1 tablespoon juice.
Step 6
Stir in olives, cilantro, garlic, red-pepper flakes and a pinch of salt. Slowly drizzle in oil, stirring to combine. Taste and add more salt, red-pepper or another squeeze of lemon, if needed.
Step 7
Place fish on plates and surround with leeks. Top with olive salsa verde.

In a medium bowl, combine the olive oil, clementine or mandarin juice, lime juice, cilantro, shallot and garlic; set aside citrus sauce.
Step 3
Scrub the potatoes and slice them into ¼-inch-thick rounds.

cup extra-virgin olive oil

Handful of thyme, rosemary and sage sprigs
½
cup roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley","139 user ratings","About 3 hours","Step 1
Season chicken inside and out with salt and pepper.
Step 2
Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. Peel the potatoes, cut them in half, then cut halves into 2 or 3 thick wedges. Boil potatoes for about 5 minutes, until barely done, then drain and cool.
Step 3
As potatoes cool, peel outer layer of garlic stalks and cut off roots. Slice both tender white and green parts crosswise into thin rings, then sprinkle with salt and roughly chop to resemble “minced.” (You should have about 1 cup of chopped alliums, whether you use green garlic, or a combination of scallions and chives.) Transfer chopped garlic to a dish and cover with olive oil.
Step 4
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Arrange potatoes on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Set the seasoned chicken on top of the potatoes. Tip the chicken up and transfer the garlic-oil mixture into the bird’s cavity, then place breast side down, with potatoes surrounding.
Step 5
Take a generous handful of herb sprigs (stem-on) and stuff into the cavity.
Step 6
Roast, uncovered, for about 1 hour until chicken is nicely browned and thigh juices run clear when probed with a paring knife. Remove chicken, tipping the inside juices onto the potatoes, and keep warm on a plate.
Step 7
Raise oven temperature to 425 degrees. Using a spatula, move the potatoes around the roasting pan, allowing juices to coat potatoes well. Return to oven to brown potatoes. Baste potatoes every 5 minutes for 15 minutes, or until potatoes are golden. Sprinkle with parsley. Carve bird and serve.
After carving, the carcass can be tossed into a saucepan, covered with water and simmered to make a small amount of garlicky broth for future use.

Choose a pot that fits the ham with enough space on top to close its lid and with space between the ham and the sides. Combine the wine, juniper berries, peppercorns, cloves and 2 tablespoons honey in the pot, and mix well. Arrange the onion in the center to form a rack for the ham and place the ham on top, flat side down. It should sit just above the wine.
Step 2
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer, basting after 15 minutes, until the ham is heated through, 30 to 40 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a sheet pan with foil. Combine the brown sugar, mustard and remaining tablespoon honey in a small bowl.
Step 4
Carefully transfer the ham to the foil-lined pan using 2 sturdy metal spatulas. The slices should have fanned open. If they haven’t, separate the slices, nudging them into a pretty arrangement. Add 1 tablespoon cooking liquid from the pot to the brown sugar mixture and stir until smooth. (Save the remaining cooking liquid for stews or braises.) Pour over the ham, spreading evenly all over the top and not letting too much spill onto the foil. Fold up the sides of the foil to form a little boat to hold any ham juices.
Step 5
Bake just until the topping is crackling and caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes. Carefully transfer to a serving platter with the spatulas, then pour the juices from the foil all over the ham. Serve immediately, with the onions from the pot, if you’d like.

Take the eggs out of the refrigerator to let them warm up a bit. (Very cold eggs can crack when they hit boiling water.)
Step 2
Combine the soy sauce, shaoxing wine, sugar, ginger, star anise, peppercorns and salt in a medium saucepan. Add 3 cups water and the tea bags, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a bare simmer while the eggs cook and cool.
Step 3
Bring a few inches of water in a large saucepan to a boil over high heat. Using a spoon, carefully and quickly add the eggs one at a time. Cook for 6 minutes for jammy yolks, 7 minutes for just-set yolks and 8 to 10 minutes for hard-boiled yolks. Pour the boiling water out of the saucepan, keeping the eggs back with a lid or spatula, then fill the saucepan with cold water from the tap. Let stand until the eggs are cool enough to handle, then drain.

To create a marbled look, tap the eggs with the back of a spoon to create hairline fractures all over with some bigger cracks but without breaking off the shells. For solid-colored eggs, peel the eggs completely. Transfer the eggs to the soy sauce mixture. Remove from the heat. Cover the saucepan or transfer everything to an airtight container and refrigerate for at least 12 hours and up to 7 days before peeling the eggs and eating. For the clearest design, be sure to peel the eggs without removing the fine membrane between the shells and eggs.

Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and gather and press it into a ball. Divide into 2 portions, one slightly larger than the other, and shape into disks. Wrap the disks tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 5 days.
Step 4
When ready to bake, heat oven to 375 degrees.
Step 5
Make the filling: If your ricotta seems watery, put it in a sieve and let it drain while you cook the spinach.
Step 6
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add spinach and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in garlic and a large pinch of salt, and continue to cook until spinach is very dry, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a large bowl to cool. If any liquid accumulates as the spinach sits, pour it out of the bowl (you don’t want it to water down the ricotta).
Step 7
In a food processor, purée drained ricotta and eggs until just combined and smooth. Add to the bowl with the spinach and fold in mozzarella, pecorino, ham (if using), parsley, black pepper, ½ teaspoon salt, red-pepper flakes and nutmeg. Set aside when rolling out dough (or chill for up to 4 hours).
Step 8
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the larger pastry dough disk to a 14-inch circle, about ⅛-inch thick. Fit dough into a 9-inch springform pan, pressing the dough up the sides of the pan. Scrape filling into crust and spread evenly. Roll out second pastry disk to a 12-inch circle, about ⅛-inch thick. Cut ½-inch-wide strips and weave into a lattice on top of the filling. Seal, trim and crimp the edges. Brush the top of the torta with the egg wash.
Step 9
Place torta on sheet pan and bake until crust is crisp and brown, and filling is firm, 50 to 60 minutes. Cool on a rack for at least 45 minutes before serving.

cup store-bought lemon curd

Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)

Black pepper
1
chicken (about 3½ to 4½ pounds)
1
tablespoon olive oil","544 user ratings","1 hour 10 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Season the lemon curd with 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper.
Step 2
To butterfly the chicken, place the chicken on a cutting board, breast side down. Using sharp kitchen shears, remove the backbone by cutting on either side of the backbone. (Save the backbone for stock.) Flip the chicken, setting it breast side up, and flatten by pressing firmly in the center; you should hear a crack.
Step 3
Pat chicken dry. Season the chicken on both sides with 2 teaspoons salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Use the handle of a fork or spoon to loosen the skin from the chicken breasts and thighs (you’ll find openings at their tops).
Step 4
Spread about three-quarters of the lemon curd between the skin and meat. Use your fingers to massage the curd around so it spreads out under the skin. Spread the rest of the lemon curd in a thin layer all over the chicken skin. Drizzle with the olive oil.
Step 5
Pour ¾ cup water into a large (at least 12-inch) oven-safe skillet, shallow roasting pan or sheet pan. (The water keeps the pan drippings from burning and keeps the chicken moist.) Add the chicken, skin side up. Tuck the wings under to prevent burning and turn the legs so the thighs face up. Roast until a thermometer registers 165 degrees in the thickest part of the thigh, 45 minutes to 1 hour, starting to check the chicken at 30 minutes. If at any point it starts getting too brown, cover it with foil. Let rest 10 minutes before carving.

½
ounce dried porcini, crushed or chopped into small pieces

Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
2
teaspoons apple cider vinegar, white wine vinegar or lemon juice, plus more as needed","636 user ratings","8 hours","Step 1
In a 5-to-8-quart slow cooker, add the beef, stock, carrots, onion, barley, thyme, porcini, 2 teaspoons salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper and 2 cups water. Stir to combine, cover and cook on low until the meat shreds when pulled with two forks, 6 to 8 hours.
Step 2
If your soup has fat on the surface, skim it with a spoon. (The amount will vary, depending on your cut of meat.) Remove and discard the thyme. If using chuck, shred the meat using two forks right in the pot; if using short ribs, transfer to a cutting board and pull the meat away from the bones. Remove any excess fat and cartilage, then chop and shred the meat and return it to the slow cooker. Stir in the vinegar. If the flavors taste muted, add salt and vinegar. If it’s too mild, add more black pepper.
Bone-in short ribs can be pricy but will create a richer broth than chuck. While 2 pounds of short ribs will still create a very savory broth, it will result in less meat in bowls.

Place a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. When hot, add neutral oil and heat for 15 seconds. Add the scallion whites and ginger, and sizzle for 30 seconds until fragrant.
Step 2
Pour in the crushed tomatoes and vegetable stock, and stir to combine. Cover, reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 to 6 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
Step 3
Add the tofu, ketchup, salt, sugar and sesame oil, and stir to combine. Taste and add more sugar and salt if needed. It should be slightly sweet, savory and a little tart. Increase heat to medium-high.
Step 4
When it comes to the boil, very slowly trickle the beaten eggs into the soup, moving in a zigzag or circular motion, distributing it evenly all over the surface of the soup. You can leave the egg to set without stirring, and this will give you larger chunks of egg. If you like longer strands, run a chopstick or wooden spoon slowly through the eggs as they set. The eggs should only take 30 to 60 seconds to cook. Turn off the heat immediately.

½
cup/3 ounces raisins
½
cup/2 ounces almond slices or peanuts, plus more for serving
1
packed cup/4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack-style vegan cheese","274 user ratings","1½ hours, plus chilling and resting","Step 1
Add the apple, onion, piloncillo, cinnamon, cloves, salt and 1 whole peeled banana to a medium pot. Depending on what type of bread you are using, add 6 cups water (if using bolillos or birotes) or 7 cups (if using a dense baguette) to the pot. Cover and bring to a boil, then turn to medium-low to simmer for 15 minutes, until the piloncillo has dissolved and the liquid becomes fragrant. Turn off the heat and let steep for 5 minutes.
Step 2
Pour the liquid through a strainer or colander, reserving the liquid and discarding the solids. Thinly slice the remaining 2 bananas and set aside.
Step 3
Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with the butter, and line the bottom of the dish with a half of the bread cubes. (You’ll need enough to cover the bottom of the dish in one layer.) Layer on half the sliced bananas, raisins, almonds and cheese. Ladle half of the liquid over the first layer until completely coated.
Step 4
Add another layer with the remaining bread, banana, raisins, almonds and cheese, then use the remaining liquid to coat the top layer. Gently press down on the bread to make sure it fully absorbs the liquid.
Step 5
Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and allow the capirotada to sit in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour so the bread fully absorbs most of the liquid.
Step 6
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Add the capirotada, still covered with foil, and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the top layer lightly browns.
Step 7
Remove from the oven and let the capirotada rest for 20 minutes before serving so it fully sets. Serve with more almond slices.
To make sure the bread pudding has structure, start with firm stale or toasted bread cubes. If you’re working with fresh bread, you can cut it into cubes, disperse evenly on a large baking sheet and broil until golden and dried, cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until toasted on top, tossing, and cooking again 1 to 2 minutes until toasted all over.

¼
cup loosely packed/5 grams fresh picked dill
¼
cup loosely packed/5 grams fresh mint leaves
½
cup/80 grams coarsely crumbled feta","749 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
Start the dukkah: In a small pan set over medium heat, toast the coriander and cumin, shaking the pan occasionally, until the seeds are a shade darker and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer spices to a small bowl and repeat with the sesame seeds, toasting for 30 to 60 seconds. Add the sesame seeds to the same bowl to cool.
Step 2
While the seeds cool, start the beans by making turmeric oil: Add 1½ tablespoons oil to the pan used for the seeds. Heat over medium until visibly hot (shimmering and wavy) but not smoking, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat, stir in the turmeric and set aside to infuse and cool completely.
Step 3
While the turmeric oil cools, finish the dukkah: Add the pistachios, oregano, mint, salt and the cooled seeds to a food processor, using the smaller bowl insert if you have one. Pulse a few times until you have a rough crumble with larger pistachio pieces. Return to the small bowl.
Step 4
Finish the beans: In a large bowl, whisk together the yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, 1 tablespoon oil and ¼ teaspoon salt. Add the butter beans and use a spatula to gently coat in the yogurt dressing, being careful to not break apart the beans.
Step 5
In a separate bowl, mix together the peas, dill, mint and remaining 1½ teaspoons oil with ⅛ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper.
Step 6
Transfer the butter bean mixture to a large plate with a lip and top with the feta, followed by the pea mixture, the turmeric oil and a generous sprinkling of the dukkah. Serve the remaining dukkah to eat alongside.

8
ounces/225 grams unsweetened chocolate
6
ounces/170 grams unsalted butter
1
teaspoon vanilla paste or extract

3½

2¾
cups/365 grams all-purpose flour (see Tip)
2
teaspoons baking powder
2
teaspoons baking soda
1½
teaspoons fine salt
3
large eggs, beaten
1½
cups/350 grams buttermilk, preferably cultured whole buttermilk
¾
cup/145 grams canola or other neutral oil
2
teaspoons pure vanilla extract","1326 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling","Step 1
Make the frosting: In a large saucepan, bring sugar and cream to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 minutes. Meanwhile, chop chocolate and cube butter. After the sugar mixture has simmered for 6 minutes, turn the heat off and add chocolate and butter to the saucepan. Stir until everything is melted. Stir in the vanilla. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature while you make the cake. Do not stir until it has cooled almost entirely, likely for as long as it will take you to mix and bake the cake.
Step 2
Make the cake: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Coat three 9-inch round cake pans with nonstick cooking spray. Cut three rounds of parchment paper to fit the bottom of each pan and line each pan with one. Spray the parchment. Sprinkle the pans with cocoa powder to coat, tapping each pan over the sink or trash can to shake loose any excess.
Step 3
Meanwhile, in a very large bowl, whisk the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Make a well in the center. Bring 1½ cups water to a boil while you prepare your wet ingredients.
Step 4
Whisk the eggs, buttermilk, oil and vanilla in a medium bowl. Pour into the dry mixture and whisk gently until incorporated. It will be a bit clumpy but gently work it in. Pour in the boiling water to loosen the batter and gently whisk to combine, being careful not to splash.
Step 5
Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans. Each pan should hold about 700 grams of batter. (Weighing your batter ensures even cooking and beautiful cake building.) Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with a few crumbs, 32 to 35 minutes. Set the pans on a wire rack to cool.
Step 6
When cakes are cooled, revisit your frosting, whisking to thicken and making sure not to overbeat or add any air or fluff to the frosting. Turn the cakes out of their pans and discard the parchment. Trim any rounded top off of each as evenly as possible.
Step 7
Assemble the cake: Scoop about ¾ cup of frosting on one layer set on a cake plate, then repeat with the second and third layers. You can refrigerate the cake in between frosting each layer to ensure that your frosting is set and firm so that your next layer will be propped up properly. If the frosting is too soft, the next layer will just flatten the filling. Frost the outside of the cake with the remaining frosting, letting it chill as you go if needed. Use an offset spatula or butter knife dipped in hot water and wiped clean to smooth and shine the finished cake. This cake keeps and is best served at room temperature for up to 2 days. It holds remarkably well in the refrigerator for up to one week and can be served cold.
You can substitute an equal amount of a gluten-free baking blend.

cup/78 grams diced candied orange peel
For the Topping
1¾
teaspoons orange blossom water (optional)
⅓
cup/50 grams bread flour (see Tip)
1
tablespoon granulated sugar","423 user ratings","4½ hours","Step 1
Make the dough: Heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium until steaming. Remove from the heat. Transfer ¼ cup/60 grams hot milk to a small bowl and let cool to 110 to 115 degrees if needed, about 1 minute. It should feel lukewarm if you stick your finger in it. Stir in the yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. If the yeast doesn’t foam, it’s dead and won’t help the dough rise. (You’ll have to buy some more and start over if this happens.)
Step 2
Meanwhile, whisk the remaining ¼ cup sugar with the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom and salt in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the butter to the milk in the saucepan and stir until it melts.
Step 3
When the butter has melted and the milk mixture is lukewarm, pour it into the dry ingredients, along with the yeast mixture and egg. If using a stand mixer, beat with the dough hook on medium-low speed until a smooth elastic ball forms, scraping the bowl and hook occasionally, about 10 minutes. The dough should feel sticky but not stick to your hands. If working by hand, mix the ingredients with your hand until a shaggy dough forms, then knead in the bowl to form a shaggy ball. Transfer to a work surface and continue kneading until smooth and elastic, about 15 minutes. You shouldn’t need to flour your surface, but, if the dough is sticking to it, lightly flour as needed.
Step 4
Add the raisins and candied orange peel to the dough and knead them in until evenly distributed. Form the dough into a ball.
Step 5
Generously butter a clean large bowl and transfer the dough ball to it. Turn the ball to coat with the butter, then cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1½ hours.
Step 6
Butter a 9-by-13-inch cake pan. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide into 12 even pieces (90 to 100 grams each) with a bench scraper, sharp knife or your hands. Form a piece into a ball by folding it over itself and pulling the stretchy dough over the fruit bits so they’re not sticking out. Once you have a smooth ball, pinch the seam at the bottom shut and place seam side down on the surface. Cup your hand over the ball and move your hand quickly in a circular motion to tighten the ball into a perfect round. Place in the prepared pan. Repeat with the remaining dough and arrange the balls in a 3-by-4 grid, spacing evenly apart. At this point, you can cover the pan tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 1 day.
Step 7
Open a large, clean unscented produce, recycling or garbage bag and slip the pan into it. Fill a tall glass with hot water, place next to the pan in the bag and tie the bag shut. (This creates a warm, steamy environment for the dough to rise.) Let the balls rise until their sides are touching, about 1½ hours (longer if the dough has been chilled).
Step 8
When the dough is almost done rising, heat the oven to 400 degrees.
Step 9
Prepare the topping: If using orange blossom water, stir 1½ teaspoons into ¼ cup/60 grams water in a small bowl. Add the flour and stir into a smooth paste. Transfer to a pastry bag or resealable plastic bag and snip a ⅓-inch hole in one corner. Pipe lines across the centers of the balls in one direction and then again in the opposite direction so that each ball has a cross.
Step 10
Bake until risen and browned, 20 to 22 minutes. The internal temperature of a center bun should register 190 degrees. While the buns are baking, heat the sugar and 1 tablespoon water in a small saucepan over medium until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and stir in the remaining ¼ teaspoon orange blossom water, if using. As soon as the buns come out of the oven, brush the syrup evenly over them. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
You can substitute 4 cups/500 grams all-purpose flour for the bread flour in the dough and ⅓ cup plus 1 tablespoon/50 grams all-purpose flour for the bread flour in the topping. The buns may not rise as high while baking and the crosses may not stand out as much, but the buns will still be delicious.
Use dark or golden raisins, whichever you prefer. If your raisins are dried out, you can make them plump and juicy again by covering them with very hot tap water (or just boiled water) and letting them stand while you prepare the dough, about 10 minutes. Drain well before kneading them into the dough.

8
ounces daikon, peeled and finely grated (1 cup)","727 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
In a large pot, combine cabbage, dashi powder and 8 cups of water, and bring to boil over high heat. Partially cover, reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is tender and flavors have melded, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Step 2
Meanwhile, bring a separate pot of water to a boil and cook soba noodles according to package instructions. Drain and run under cool water to remove excess starch and to stop the cooking. Drain well and divide soba among 4 bowls.
Step 3
In a small bowl, mix scallions with ponzu, oil and ginger and set aside. Once cabbage is tender, add tofu and bring broth back to a gentle simmer. Reduce heat to low and arrange salmon slices on top so that they’re slightly overlapping and just covered by the broth. Cover and cook until salmon is just opaque throughout, 1½ to 2 minutes. (The fish will continue to cook off the heat.)
Step 4
Divide broth and salmon among the 4 bowls. Top each serving with some of the grated daikon and spoon some of the ponzu-scallions sauce over the fish and broth. Serve warm with any remaining ponzu-scallion sauce on the side.
Dashi powder instantly adds depth, umami and smokiness, but a small piece of dried kelp can work as a substitute in a bind. (Just discard it once the broth is done.) The Hondashi brand is widely available in Asian markets or online.

(Don’t worry if they are not perfect; the brittle will be cut up later.)
Step 3
In a medium saucepan, melt the butter and brown sugar over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture comes to a boil, about 6 minutes. Boil just until very bubbly, another 2 to 3 minutes, then remove from heat and pour over the matzo, covering completely. Working quickly, spread the caramel using a heatproof spatula, then spoon it on top if it spills between the cracks in the matzo.
Step 4
Place the baking sheet in the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 degrees. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, checking to make sure the edges and top are not burning.
Step 5
Once the matzo is almost done baking, heat the peanut butter in a microwave until slightly warmed and easily pourable, about 20 to 30 seconds on high.
Step 6
Remove the matzo from the oven and drizzle the warmed peanut butter on top, then sprinkle with the peanuts, then the salt. Cool, break into pieces then transfer to a lidded container. Brittle is best — and at its snappiest — when chilled. Refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes or freeze for 15 until peanut butter firms up. Brittle will keep up to 1 month frozen; let it thaw for about 10 minutes before serving.

large red onions, cut into rounds

tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

white or yellow onions, diced

bell peppers (green, red and yellow), diced

(14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes (Kosher for Passover), drained
2
cups chicken, beef or vegetable stock (Kosher for Passover)
1
tablespoon brown sugar
1
teaspoon prepared horseradish
2
fresh or dried bay leaves
1
sprig fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried thyme","311 user ratings","4½ hours","Step 1
Heat oven to 325 degrees. Combine the paprika, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cinnamon, chile powder and cayenne with the salt and pepper. Save 2 teaspoons for the vegetables, then sprinkle the rest all over the brisket and rub in well.
Step 2
Arrange the red onion rounds in a single layer in a roasting pan or large baking dish that can fit the brisket and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil.
Step 3
Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil over medium-low in a very large Dutch oven or large, deep skillet that fits the brisket. Cook the beef until lightly seared (don’t let the spices burn), about 5 to 6 minutes on both sides. Transfer to the roasting pan, placing the brisket on top of the red onion rounds.
Step 4
Add the diced onions and bell peppers to the oil in the Dutch oven and season with the saved 2 teaspoons of seasoning. Raise the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, mix together, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often.
Step 5
Add the stock, brown sugar, horseradish, bay leaves and thyme. Spoon the vegetables over the brisket to cover it and pour everything else from the Dutch oven into the roasting pan.
Step 6
Cover the pan tightly with foil. If the foil touches the top of the brisket, cover the brisket with parchment paper first, then cover the pan with the foil. Bake until a fork slides into the brisket with only a little resistance, about 3½ hours.
Step 7
To serve right away, transfer the brisket to a cutting board and cut across the grain into thin slices. Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with salt and spoon the vegetables on top. You can serve the remaining sauce alongside or save for another use. To make ahead, cool the brisket, then cover tightly and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Once the brisket is chilled, cut off and discard excess fat if you’d like, and then slice the meat against the grain. Place the sliced brisket in a pan or pot, cover with the vegetables and sauce, and heat in a 350-degree oven until heated through, about 30 minutes.

whole kosher chickens, preferably fryers (3 to 3½ pounds each)
4
large eggs
2
cups matzo meal

Neutral oil, for frying (see Tip)","56 user ratings","2 hours, plus chilling and resting","Step 1
Combine the salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, paprika, ginger, cinnamon, allspice and cloves in a bowl.
Step 2
Rinse chickens and pat dry. Cut each into pieces: breasts, wings, drumsticks and thighs. If the breast halves are very large, cut them in half crosswise. Season the chicken all over with the spice mixture, cover and refrigerate for a few hours.
Step 3
Beat the eggs with a fork in a shallow dish, then mix in 2 tablespoons water. Place matzo meal in another dish. Set up two racks over two large baking sheets lined with paper towels. Dip each chicken piece in the eggs to thoroughly coat, then in the matzo meal. Set on the racks, arranging breasts, wings, legs and thighs together. Let sit for about 15 minutes at room temperature so the coating can set.
Step 4
Meanwhile, add oil to a depth of 1¼ inches in a large, deep frying pan or Dutch oven and heat over medium to about 325 degrees. Working in batches by chicken parts and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a steady sizzle, fry the breasts then the dark meat until browned all around and 165 degrees or higher for white meat and 175 degrees for dark meat, 7 to 8 minutes per side. If needed, continue cooking pieces to brown evenly or cook through, about 4 minutes. Use your best judgment (and a meat thermometer): Crispy and golden brown on the outside doesn’t necessarily mean done on the inside.
Step 5
Line large platters with paper towels. As the chicken pieces finish cooking, remove them with tongs and place them on the platters to drain. Sprinkle with salt, if you’d like, and serve hot or warm.
If needed or desired, use oil that is kosher for Passover. If following Sephardic kosher for passover guidelines, use corn or peanut oil.

Heat oven to 400 degrees and lightly butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish or large, shallow gratin dish.
Step 2
Coarsely chop one of the yellow onions. Cut the remaining yellow and red onions from root to stem into ¾-inch-thick wedges and set aside.
Step 3
In a large skillet over medium-high heat, combine chopped yellow onion, 2 cups water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and cook, partly covered, until onions are very tender, 15 to 20 minutes.

Use a vegetable peeler to peel the rind off the lime in wide strips. Add the rind to a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, along with the garlic and ¼ cup water. (Reserve the lime.)
Step 2
In a large bowl, stir together the herbs, yogurt, turmeric, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Add the meat and use your hands to combine. Form the meat into 8 balls (roughly 4½ ounces each) and add to the slow cooker in a single layer. If they don’t fit in one layer, add a few tomatoes to buffer the meatballs from one another, then add another layer of meatballs. Add the cherry tomatoes, season with salt and pepper, then cover and cook on low until the meatballs are cooked through, 3 to 4 hours.
Step 3
Transfer the meatballs to plates, then remove and discard the garlic and lime peel. Burst most of the tomatoes by smashing them on the side of the slow cooker with a spoon. Squeeze the reserved lime into the slow cooker, then season to taste with salt, pepper and sugar. (The sugar helps compensate for too-tart tomatoes.) Spoon the tomatoes and broth on top of the meatballs, along with more fresh herbs.
To make this dish on the stovetop, cook the tomato sauce first (follow the timing in step 3 here), then add the meatballs and cover to cook through.

1½
cups sake

Soft-boiled eggs (optional)
3
tablespoons granulated sugar
3
tablespoons soy sauce

Karashi (Japanese mustard paste), for serving (optional)","212 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Heat a frying pan over medium (you don’t need to oil the pan) and sear the pork pieces on all sides until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. At the same time, bring a medium pot of water to a boil.
Step 2
Remove the pork from the frying pan and wipe off the excess fat with paper towels. Place the pork and ginger in the boiling water, cover with a Japanese drop lid (see Tip) or make your own by shaping a sheet of aluminum foil into a round slightly smaller than the diameter of your pot, cutting large holes all through the foil for ventilation and setting it over the pork. Simmer for 20 minutes.
Step 3
Drain pork and rinse under running water. Discard ginger. Place pork in a bowl, cover with cold water and allow meat to cool for 5 minutes, changing the water twice.
Step 4
Lay the pork pieces in a single layer in the same pot (no need to wash), and add the sake and enough water so the liquids just cover the meat (about 4 cups). Bring to a boil over medium heat, skimming the scum as needed, then reduce the heat to low. Cover with the drop lid or foil with holes. Simmer for 1 hour, replenishing with water if needed. If you want to serve this dish with soft-boiled eggs, start preparing them now and then peel them.
Step 5
After the pork has simmered for an hour, add the sugar to the pot. Simmer for another 5 minutes, then check meat for tenderness. A skewer should slide through easily. Continue simmering if needed.
Step 6
Add the soy sauce to the pot, along with the peeled soft-boiled eggs, if using. Simmer for another 10 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, and allow the dish to cool.
Step 7
When ready to serve, pour ¼ cup broth from the pot into a frying pan, and allow it to reduce for 5 minutes to create a sauce. To serve, place kakuni pork pieces and eggs, if serving, in dishes, and top with the sauce. Serve with karashi to taste, if using.
A Japanese drop lid, otoshibuta, is smaller in diameter than its pot so that it can rest directly on top of the ingredients, keeping solids submerged in liquid. Some come with holes on top. They’re available online and in Japanese markets and houseware stores.

Add a handful of the squid to the oil and cook until golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Stir only after the coating seems to have set. (Any sooner and the coating could fall off.) Use a slotted spoon or tongs to transfer to the lined plate. Season with salt.

pound firm, nonstarchy potatoes, such as red bliss or Yukon Gold","245 user ratings","About 3½ hours","Step 1
Reserve a small handful of cilantro and 5 scallions. To a large stockpot or Dutch oven, add the split onion, the garlic cloves, the cumin seeds and the beef. Cover with water by 2 inches (3 to 4 quarts total).
Step 2
Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain a very bare simmer. Using a ladle, skim off and discard any solid scum that has collected on the surface. Roughly chop the remaining cilantro and scallions, and add them to the pot. Cover and cook until the beef is tender and a skewer or knife shows no resistance when poked through the meat, 2½ to 3 hours.
Step 3
Using tongs or a skimmer, remove the meat with the bones to a large plate and set aside.
Step 4
Set a fine mesh strainer in a large bowl and strain the broth. Discard the solids. Scrub out the pot, then return the broth to it and season to taste with salt. (It should taste quite salty.) Proceed immediately to the next step, or return the beef to the broth and refrigerate in sealed containers for up to a week before continuing (or adapting into one of the alternate serving methods, see Note).
Step 5
Peel the potatoes, halve or quarter them lengthwise, then cut crosswise into ⅓- to ½-inch-thick slices and add them to the broth. Simmer the potato slices in the broth until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Return the beef to the broth.
Step 6
Roughly chop the reserved cilantro and scallions, and add to the broth. Serve immediately.
After chilling at the end of Step 4, the beef and broth can be adapted into other dishes. For instance:
• A simple take on pozole verde: Reheat a couple quarts of the broth and beef with 1 (30-ounce) can drained hominy and a big pinch of dried oregano. Serve with sliced cabbage, diced yellow onion, thinly sliced radish, lime wedges and tortillas or tostadas.
• Faux pho: Simmer a couple quarts of broth with whole star anise, a cinnamon stick, a small handful of coriander seeds and some sliced ginger for 15 minutes. Strain broth. Add braised beef, some sugar, a dash of fish sauce and cooked pho noodles. Serve with basil and cilantro leaves, fresh bean sprouts, sliced onion, lime wedges and chiles.
• Easy beef-barley soup: Simmer a couple of quarts of broth with ½ cup each of finely diced carrots, celery, onion and pearled barley until vegetables and barley are tender. Add some braised beef (deboned and shredded, if you prefer), a good grind of black pepper and a handful of minced fresh parsley leaves.

teaspoon orange blossom water or rose water, or a combination
¼
cup/about 1 ounce finely ground unroasted, unsalted pistachios, preferably Turkish, for finishing","287 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the syrup: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar, lemon juice and ¼ cup water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower heat and simmer until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Set aside to cool completely, then stir in ½ teaspoon orange blossom water and ½ teaspoon rose water.
Step 2
Make the batter: Add 1¼ cups plus 2 tablespoons water to a blender or food processor. Add all the batter ingredients and process until smooth. The batter should be quite loose, similar to heavy cream in consistency. Set aside to rest for 15 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Place the mascarpone, heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, ½ teaspoon orange blossom water and ½ teaspoon rose water in a small bowl. Use a handheld electric mixer to whip into stiff peaks. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Step 4
Cook the qatayef: Place a medium nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat until hot. Mix the batter to ensure it is smooth, then pour separate 1-tablespoon portions of batter into the pan, fitting about 4 circles. Cook qatayef until the entire surface is covered in small bubbles and the center loses its sheen, about 30 to 45 seconds. (You might be able to cook off more at a time once you’ve determined the right temperature and consistency of the batter.) If the bubbles are large and sparse, then your batter is too thick; stir 1 tablespoon of water into the batter to thin. Qatayef cook only on one side; the base should be uniformly golden and the top covered in small bubbles. If the disks brown too quickly — or unevenly — underneath before the batter loses its sheen on top, lower the heat slightly.
Step 5
Transfer each cooked qatayef to a large tray lined with a dish towel and cover with another dish towel while you cook the remaining batter.
Step 6
Fill the qatayef: Fold each into a half-moon, bubble side on the inside, and pinch to seal the edges together halfway. Using a teaspoon or a piping bag, fill the opening with the cream, then dip the exposed cream filling into the ground pistachios.
Step 7
Arrange the filled qatayef on a serving platter. These can be covered in plastic wrap and refrigerated for several hours until ready to serve. To serve, drizzle the cooled syrup over the qatayef and offer guests more syrup to add to their individual plates, if they choose.
Mahlab, the kernel found inside the pit of a cherry, adds a floral and nutty aroma to sweets and gives Arabic cheese its distinct flavor. It is available whole or ground from Middle Eastern grocery stores, but goes rancid quickly, so buy it whole and grind it as needed, storing the rest in the freezer until needed.

tablespoons of lemon juice, from about half a large lemon
½
teaspoon garam masala, for garnish
1
tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish

Rice or roti, for serving (optional)","578 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
In a large (about 6-quart) pot, add 7 cups of water, the whole masoor dal and bay leaf. Bring to a boil, cover and cook on as high heat as possible until tender, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Step 2
In the meantime, prepare the masala: In a medium-sized (8-inch) frying pan, heat ghee over medium heat for 30 to 45 seconds or until melted. Add onion, ginger and garlic, and cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Add cumin, chile powder, turmeric and coriander. Mix well. Stir in tomatoes, add salt and Thai green chiles. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes break down and the oil separates (it will form an outline around the jammy tomato), about 10 minutes.
Step 3
Remove 1 cup water from the pot of dal with a ladle (remove more if you want the dal to be thicker, or less or none of you prefer it thinner). Stir the masala from the frying pan into the pot of dal. Simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, or for 10 minutes for more tender dal. Turn off the stove, and stir in lemon juice. Sprinkle with garam masala and cilantro. Serve with rice, roti or by itself.

"Seared Chicken With Salami and Olives","Poultry,Brown Sugar,Chicken,Olives,Salami,Dinner,Weekday,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","1½ to 2
pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, patted dry
2
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
4
ounces salami, coarsely chopped (about 1 cup)
1
large shallot, coarsely chopped
1
cup pitted, halved olives, preferably a mild green olive like Castelvetrano or Picholine (see Tip)
½
tablespoon cold unsalted butter

Honey or light or dark brown sugar, to taste","378 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
If you’re using chicken breasts, pound to an even ½-inch thickness with a heavy skillet or meat pounder. In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high. Season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper. Working in batches if necessary to avoid crowding the pan, add the chicken to the skillet and cook until browned underneath, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook until cooked through, 2 to 5 minutes. (Breasts will be done before thighs.)
Step 2
While the chicken’s cooking, place 1 cup of water near the stove. (You’ll need it in the next step.) Transfer the cooked chicken to a plate, leaving the skillet over the heat.
Step 3
Reduce the heat to medium. Add the salami and a few generous grinds of pepper. Cook, stirring, until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the shallot and cook until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the water, increase heat to a simmer and cook, scraping up browned bits, until reduced by half, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the olives, chicken and any juices from the plate. Simmer until the chicken is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes.
Step 4
Transfer the chicken to serving plates. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the butter until incorporated. Taste the sauce; if it’s too salty, add honey or brown sugar to taste. Spoon the sauce over the chicken.
If using a saltier olive like black oil-cured, reduce the quantity.

slices provolone (about 3 ounces), torn or cut into bite-size pieces (or use 1½ ounces aged provolone)","861 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Rinse the sliced shallot under cold water and transfer to a large bowl.
Step 2
Cut the stalks away from the broccoli heads. Using a knife or vegetable peeler, remove the fibrous outer layer of the stalks so its light green insides emerge; compost or discard the outer layer. Thinly slice the stalks crosswise, then thinly slice the heads into bite-size pieces. (A mix of shapes and sizes adds texture to the salad, so chop up the broccoli a few ways; there’s no one right way to go about it.) Transfer to the large bowl as you go, then transfer any loose bits from the cutting board to the bowl.
Step 3
Season the broccoli generously with salt and pepper, then add the almonds, pickled peppers, olives, oil, vinegar and provolone. Toss vigorously with a spoon until everything is combined and the broccoli is shiny with oil.
Step 4
Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper, oil and vinegar as needed. Let sit at least 10 minutes before serving. The salad improves with age as its flavors meld, and it can be refrigerated for up to 4 days. Before serving, bring to room temperature and adjust salt, pepper, oil and vinegar to taste, as flavors change in the fridge.

Canola or other neutral oil, for frying (optional)
3 to 4

1
medium onion, halved and thinly sliced (optional)
½ to 1
cup pomegranate seeds
½
cup fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves

For the Lentils

medium onions, chopped
2
tablespoons tamarind concentrate
1½
tablespoons pomegranate molasses
1
tablespoon salt, plus more to taste
6
garlic cloves, minced
2
cups fresh cilantro, chopped
3
tablespoons lemon juice, plus more to taste (from 2 to 3 lemons)","479 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Put lentils in a medium bowl and add warm water to cover by 2 inches. Set aside to soak for 30 minutes.
Step 2
If you’re making the dough, prepare it while the lentils soak: Combine the flour, warm water, and the olive oil in a medium bowl. Mix the ingredients to combine, then knead in the bowl until smooth, about 3 minutes. Brush with olive oil, then let rest in the bowl, covered with a clean towel, for 30 minutes.
Step 3
If you’re making the optional fried flatbread or onion garnishes, prepare them while the dough rests: Fill a large saucepan with canola oil to a depth of 1 to 2 inches. Bring to 350 degrees over high heat. (A piece of flatbread should sizzle vigorously.) Line 2 plates with paper towels. Working in 2 batches, fry the flatbread until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Transfer to one of the prepared plates to drain. Allow the oil to come back to 350 degrees. Working in 2 batches, fry the onion, separating the slices as you add them and stirring occasionally, until crisp, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer to the other plate to drain.
Step 4
Make the lentils: Fill a large pot with 9 cups of water. Drain and rinse the lentils, then add them to the water, along with the cumin. Bring to a boil over high heat, then drop the heat to medium-low and let simmer until the lentils are slightly softened but still firm, about 10 minutes. You can scoop one out to test the texture.
Step 5
Meanwhile, put a large frying pan over medium heat. Add ¼ cup olive oil, and when the oil is hot, add the onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn pliant and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. When the lentils are softened yet firm, add the onions and their oil, along with the tamarind concentrate, pomegranate molasses and 1 tablespoon salt. (If you’re using dried store-bought tagliatelle — see Tip — add it now as well.) Stir and let simmer until the lentils are completely softened but not mushy, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 6
While the lentils cook, continue preparing the dough: Dust a clean surface with flour. Pat and stretch the dough into a thin sheet (1/16-inch thick, about 12 inches in diameter) and dust it with flour on both sides. Roll up the dough into a cylinder and cut crosswise into strands about ¼-inch thick. Unroll each piece, carefully separating the dough with your fingers as you go. You will end up with long strands like tagliatelle.
Step 7
When the lentils are softened, add the strands of dough and cook until al dente, about 3 minutes. (If you used dried pasta, it should be done about this time.) While the dough cooks, take the pan used to fry the onions and heat the remaining ¼ cup olive oil over medium. Add the garlic and cilantro, and fry just until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. The garlic shouldn’t change color, and the cilantro should stay green.
Step 8
When the dough is al dente, add the garlic mixture to the lentils, along with the lemon juice. Let simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes, then switch off the heat. Season to taste with more salt and lemon juice.
Step 9
Serve the lentils and dough in a shallow dish. Top with the pomegranate seeds, parsley and fried bread and/or onions, if using, in separate rows. Drizzle with olive oil.
Traditionally, this dish was a way to use scraps of dough left over from baking bread. You can make a quick dough as outlined above, or simply substitute 4 ounces of dried tagliatelle pasta and add to the lentils at the beginning of Step 5.

medium plum tomato, finely chopped

1¼ teaspoons fine sea salt
2 to 3
tablespoons lime juice
¼
teaspoon garam masala

Roti or pita (optional), for serving","304 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
In a medium (9-inch) frying pan or wok, heat 2 tablespoons ghee over medium-high for 30 to 45 seconds or until it has melted. Add okra and cook undisturbed for 5 minutes or until okra starts to brown around the edges. (Cooking okra undisturbed helps eliminate the gooeyness.) Stir once so the sides with less color can brown next, then cook for another 5 minutes or until all the okra is brown around the edges. (This may take slightly longer if using frozen okra.) Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.
Step 2
Add the remaining 1 tablespoon ghee to the same frying pan and heat over medium-high until it melts. Add ginger and garlic and stir for about 30 seconds, until the raw smell dissipates. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until onions begin to soften, about 3 to 5 minutes. (The onions should still have a little bite.)
Step 3
Lower the heat to medium and add red chile, coriander and turmeric, and stir until the masalas are uniformly mixed with the onion, about 30 seconds. Add tomato and salt. Continue cooking on medium until tomatoes break down, about 5 minutes.
Step 4
Add okra back to the pan and mix until incorporated. Sprinkle with lime juice and garam masala. Serve with roti, store-bought pita or by itself.
If using fresh okra, make sure to pat it dry before chopping. This reduces the sticky texture common to okra.

Arrange racks in the upper and lower thirds of your oven. Heat oven to 425 degrees.
Step 2
Prepare the cauliflower: In a large bowl, whisk together olive oil, cumin, paprika, salt, coriander, turmeric, black pepper and cayenne. Add cauliflower and onion, and toss until well coated. Spread mixture in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet.
Step 3
Roast vegetables on the top oven rack until they are golden brown, slightly crisp and tender, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once or twice. If the vegetables look dry as they roast, drizzle with a little more olive oil.
Step 4
As they cook, prepare the tahini sauce: Whisk together lemon juice, 1 teaspoon harissa, garlic and salt in a small bowl, and let sit for a minute or two to mellow the garlic. Whisk in tahini. Whisk in ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce is smooth and thin enough to drizzle. You may not need all of the water or you may need to add a little more: Tahini brands vary a lot. Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more harissa, lemon juice and salt if you like. The sauce should taste zippy and creamy.
Step 5
Warm the pitas or flatbread by placing them directly on the bottom oven rack during the last 5 minutes as the vegetables roast. (Or you can warm the bread on another baking pan if that’s easier for you.)
Step 6
Scatter parsley on top of the roasted vegetables and serve with warm pitas, tahini sauce, chopped tomato, cucumber and olives.

slices of prosciutto (optional)

Fresh ricotta (preferably a local or all-natural brand), for serving (optional)","209 user ratings","30 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Prepare the rice: Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil and salt it. Stir in the rice. When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook the rice at a gentle simmer for about 15 minutes, or until tender but still a bit firm and not at all mushy. Drain the rice in a colander set in the sink, then transfer it to a large bowl. You can refrigerate it after this step or use it once it has cooled completely.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the peas, olive oil, sliced onion, lemon zest and juice, red-pepper flakes and ½ teaspoon salt. Allow to marinate, refrigerated, for 20 minutes or up to 3 days.
Step 3
Remove the sliced onion from the pea mixture and discard. Add 5 cups of the cooled or refrigerated rice to the pea mixture, along with the basil, mint, parsley and chives; toss gently to combine. Taste for salt and lemon juice. This is important — get it the way you want it. If the ratio needs a bit more rice, add it from whatever is left. (You should have another cup or so.) You may also wish to add more herbs.
Step 4
Serve in shallow bowls, draping a couple of slices of prosciutto alongside for each person. Alternatively, a spoonful of really good ricotta on top is also delicious. Or, serve with both prosciutto and ricotta — although vegetarians and vegans will enjoy this dish without the meat or dairy. Set out lemon wedges to squeeze to taste.

½
teaspoon kosher salt
½

4
medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 ½ pounds), trimmed of excess fat","241 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
In a small food processor, combine the garlic, orange juice, olive oil, sazón, salt and pepper; pulse until it forms a creamy marinade. (Alternately, you can finely mince the garlic, then combine it with the rest of the ingredients in a small bowl, stirring with a fork.)
Step 2
Pat the chicken breasts dry, then transfer them to a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade on top, close, shake, then gently massage the seasoning into the meat. Let sit on the counter for at least 10 minutes. (Chicken can also be marinated overnight then set out to come to room temperature before cooking.)
Step 3
Heat a large nonstick wok or deep skillet over medium-high. Add marinated chicken breasts, one by one, and pour over about half the marinade. Cook for 7 to 10 minutes, flipping frequently with tongs and being careful not to let them get too dark too fast. Reduce heat to low and cook for another 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the breast, flipping often to ensure meat is cooked through. Thinner chicken breasts will take less time to cook, so monitor the color and texture of your meat as it cooks. Check doneness by pressing the center with your tongs. If the center is still squishy, continue to cook until meat has a bit of resistance (though not rock hard), and registers 165 degrees on a meat thermometer.
Step 4
Let rest in the pan off-heat for a few minutes. Serve, pouring over any remaining pan juices if desired.

1
tablespoon soy sauce
1
tablespoon fish sauce
1½
teaspoons distilled white vinegar
1½
teaspoons Thai black soy sauce or another thick, sweet soy sauce","1874 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Prepare the noodles: Place dried noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot tap water. Let soak while you prepare the remaining ingredients, allowing the water to cool, and stirring and separating the noodles occasionally with your hands. (This will take 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the brand.) When ready, noodles will be white, limp and almost soft to the bite. (They will cook a little more later on.) Pour off all the water, fluff noodles with your hands, and set aside.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a bowl, combine the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar and black soy sauce.
Step 3
Make the noodles: Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles. Using the flat side of a wide, heavy knife, smash the garlic and chiles. If you have a mortar and pestle, crush the peeled garlic and seeded chiles into a rough paste. If not, use a small food processor to mince together, or just use the knife to mince the garlic and leave the smashed chiles whole.
Step 4
Place the remaining ingredients in bowls and line them up in the order they’ll be added to the pan: protein, greens (if using), noodles, sauce and basil. When ready to cook, put 1 cup of hot tap water near the stove.
Step 5
Heat the oil in a 14-inch wok, a heavy 12-inch skillet or a large Dutch oven over medium until shimmering. (If using a smaller pan, cook in 2 batches.) Add garlic mixture and stir-fry over medium heat just until sizzling and fragrant, stirring with a wok turner, spatula or tongs, 30 to 45 seconds.
Step 6
Add the protein, raise the heat to high and stir-fry for 2 minutes. If using, add gai lan. Keep cooking until protein is just cooked through and greens are wilted, 1 to 2 minutes longer.
Step 7
Add noodles, spreading them around the pan, tossing and separating them. When noodles are sizzling, add 3 tablespoons sauce and stir-fry, tossing to coat and cook through.
Step 8
Taste noodles for doneness and seasoning. If needed, add more pad kee mao sauce a little at a time until the dish is spicy and savory and not too sweet. Add hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if noodles are not quite soft.
Step 9
When the noodles have absorbed all the sauce and the flavors are balanced, add the basil leaves and toss to combine. Serve immediately.

Prepare the noodles: Place dried noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot tap water. Let soak while you prepare the remaining ingredients, allowing the water to cool, and stirring and separating the noodles occasionally with your hands. (This will take 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the brand.) When ready, noodles will be white, limp and bouncy, almost soft to the bite. (They will cook a little more later.) Pour off and discard all the water, fluff noodles with your hands and set aside.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, mix the meat with the soy sauce and let stand at room temperature.
Step 3
Prepare the sauce: In a bowl, whisk the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce and white pepper to combine.
Step 4
Place the remaining noodle ingredients in bowls and line them up in the order they’ll be added to the pan: garlic, gai lan, eggs, noodles and sugar, then the sauce. When ready to cook, put 1 cup of hot tap water near the stove, and drain and discard any liquid in the bowl with the meat.
Step 5
Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a 14-inch wok or a heavy 12-inch skillet or a large Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. (If using a smaller pan, cook in 2 batches.) Add the meat to the hot pan in a single layer. Let cook, undisturbed, until well browned, about 1 minute, then stir-fry until just cooked through, about 1 minute more, pressing it against the pan to sear. Remove from the pan and set aside.
Step 6
Wipe out the pan and heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium until shimmering. Stir in the garlic, then immediately add the greens and stir-fry just until bright and beginning to wilt, 30 to 45 seconds.
Step 7
Push greens to one side of the pan, add just enough oil to lightly coat the other side and add the eggs. Use the spatula to scramble the eggs, stirring and scraping until cooked through and just dry, about 1 minute.
Step 8
Raise the heat to high. Add the noodles, spreading them around the pan, then tossing and separating them with a wok turner, tongs or both. When noodles are sizzling, add the sugar and 3 tablespoons sauce, and toss to coat and cook through. Keep cooking, leaving noodles undisturbed for 20 to 30 seconds at a time, so they sear and caramelize.
Step 9
Add the meat back to the pan, along with any liquids in the dish, and toss everything together.
Step 10
Add a few dashes of black soy sauce, and taste for doneness and seasoning. Keep cooking, adding more sugar, black soy sauce or pad see ew sauce a little at a time, until the dish is very savory and a little sweet. Add hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if noodles are not quite soft.

1
cup/180 grams vegetable shortening
¼
cup/22 grams cocoa powder combined with 3 tablespoons boiling water","336 user ratings","1½ hours, plus rising time","Step 1
Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the milk, eggs and vanilla. Mix on the lowest speed to combine without the flour splattering out of the bowl, about 20 seconds. (If needed, use a spatula to push the flour mixture toward the hook.) Raise speed to medium-high and mix until the dough slaps and pulls away from the sides of the bowl and starts to form a smooth, elastic ball around the hook, 10 to 15 minutes. Stay close to your mixer because it will start jumping all over your counter.
Step 2
Reduce speed to low and add the butter gradually, in 3 to 4 additions. Once all butter is added, increase speed to medium-high. Continue mixing until the dough is again pulling away from the sides of the bowl, loudly slapping it and gathering into a very soft, elastic, silky and shiny mass that hugs the dough hook, 8 to 12 minutes. Again, stay close to your mixer because it will jump. The moment you stop beating the dough, it will relax into the bowl again.
Step 3
Transfer the dough to a large buttered bowl. To activate the gluten further, stretch and fold the dough: Using one or both of your hands, reach down between the greased side of the bowl and the dough, and lift the dough up out of the bowl and fold the dough over itself. Rotate the bowl 90 degrees and repeat the process three more times. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, place it in the refrigerator for the first rise and let it chill anywhere from 4 hours to 24 hours.
Step 4
Cover three 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper. Cover a small area of your countertop with a light layer of flour. Bring the dough out of the refrigerator and, using your hands or a bench scraper, cut it into 15 pieces, each about 76 grams, which is about a ⅓-cup scoop. One by one, pat each piece of dough into a flat shape on the floured surface, then draw the edges into the center, working your way around, pinching the dough together into the center of what should now be a ball. Turn the ball over, cup it with your hand and move it in circles, rolling it over the counter for a few seconds to make a neater round. Repeat with the remaining conchas and place 5 equally spaced balls on each of the 3 prepared baking sheets. Make sure there is a bit of flour on the counter before pressing each piece of dough, as the dough is very sticky.
Step 5
Make your preferred topping (see Tip): Combine all the ingredients for the selected topping flavor in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed until the ingredients begin to combine, about 20 to 30 seconds. Raise the speed to medium and mix to form a glossy and smooth mixture, about 2 minutes.
Step 6
Fill a small bowl halfway with warm water to wet your hands while you work to divide and shape the topping. Portion the topping with a soup spoon to create 15 portions that are about 30 grams each. Wet your hands thoroughly and roll one portion of the topping into a ball. Set the ball in one palm and, using the other hand, pat it out into a 3½-inch round, as if you were patting a thick tortilla. (The topping is very sticky and soft, like a thick frosting, so you should moisten your hands as needed.) Place the round disk over a concha and slide your fingers around the edges of the topping, pressing it lightly around the rim to gently adhere to the bun. The topping should not go all the way down to the parchment paper, but be at least about ¼ inch from it. Repeat to top the remaining conchas, keeping your hands wet throughout.
Step 7
To make a shell pattern, dip a concha mold into flour to coat and very gently press the mold on the topping from one side to the other in a rolling motion, doing so swiftly and with determination as you move from side to side. (Dipping the mold in flour prevents it from sticking to the topping and prevents the topping from peeling away from the dough.) The mold should make a shell-shaped mark on the concha topping, merely indenting it without breaking through to the dough. If you don’t have a concha mold, you can make the shape with a dinner knife by dipping it in flour and marking each concha with curves, lines or squares, but avoiding piercing through to the dough.
Step 8
Cover the conchas with clean kitchen towels and set in a warm, draft-free area of your kitchen until they puff considerably, anywhere from 1½ to 2 hours. (They don’t need to double in size.) At this point, the shaped toppings may have spread slightly, opening a bit more into the indented shapes.
Step 9
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Bake the conchas until golden brown and even more puffed, about 20 to 22 minutes. (If all three sheet pans don’t fit in the oven at once, you can simply bake the third batch after you’ve baked the first two.) Remove from the oven.
Step 10
Let rest for a few minutes before serving. Conchas are best the day they are baked, but can be stored in an airtight container for up to 4 days.
Bread flour will yield buns with a more defined and slightly taller round shape, a more doughy and chewy texture, and a slightly less sweet taste.
Each of the three toppings yields enough to cover the full recipe of 15 conchas, but if you would like to try multiple flavor profiles, you can simply divide each topping by two or three. Due to the smaller amount, you’ll need to blend the ingredients using a hand mixer, or simply in a bowl with a spatula.

1½
cups red seedless grapes
2
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
1
wedge of Manchego cheese (about 2 ounces), rind removed

1
teaspoon Dijon mustard
¼
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
⅛
teaspoon black pepper
¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil","500 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 400 degrees. Once heated, place walnuts on a sheet pan and cook until toasted and fragrant, about 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer nuts to a cutting board to cool. (You’ll use the sheet pan in the next step.)
Step 2
Cut the fennel bulbs in half lengthwise, then cut each half into 1-inch wedges (you’ll have about 6), taking care to include a bit of core in each slice to hold it together while cooking. Arrange the slices on the sheet pan, ensuring they do not overlap. Add the grapes to a corner of the sheet pan. Drizzle 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over the fennel and grapes. Season with ¼ teaspoon kosher salt and ⅛ teaspoon pepper. Roast for 40 minutes, flipping the fennel and shaking the grapes around at the 20-minute mark. When done, the fennel should be tender and browned; the grapes should be a bit withered and caramelized in some spots. Remove from oven and let cool for at least 5 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, roughly chop the cooled walnuts, and set aside while you prepare the dressing: In a small glass jar, combine the shallot, sherry vinegar, orange zest and juice, mustard, salt, black pepper and olive oil. Cover and shake well to combine. Set aside.
Step 4
Assemble the salad: Transfer the roasted fennel and grapes to a platter. Spoon 4 tablespoons of the dressing over the roasted fennel and grapes, ensuring the shallot rings are evenly distributed. (Extra dressing can be served alongside.) Top with chopped nuts. Just before serving, grate the Manchego cheese on the largest hole of a box grater. Top salad with Manchego, reserved fennel fronds and a few more cracks of black pepper. Serve immediately.

Prepare the noodles: Place dried noodles in a large bowl and cover with hot tap water. Let soak for 20 to 30 minutes while you prepare the remaining ingredients, allowing the water to cool, and stirring and separating the noodles occasionally with your hands. When ready, noodles will be white, limp and almost soft to the bite. (They will cook a little more later on.) Pour off all the water, fluff noodles with your hands, and set aside.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the sauce: Combine the fish sauce, tamarind and coconut palm sugar in a small saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, stirring often, just until sugar has dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside to cool.
Step 3
Line up the ingredients in the order they’ll be cooked: Place the garlic, shallot, radish and shrimp in a bowl, then line up the tofu, noodles, sauce, eggs, bean sprouts and chives. When ready to cook, place 1 cup of hot tap water near the stove.
Step 4
Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a 14-inch wok, a heavy 12-inch skillet or a large Dutch oven medium-high heat until shimmering. (If using a smaller pan, cook in 2 batches.) Add the contents of the garlic bowl and stir-fry over medium heat, adjusting the flame so the ingredients are sizzling but not popping or scorching, until the shrimp are nearly pink, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tofu and stir-fry to heat through, about 2 minutes.
Step 5
Add noodles and raise the heat as high as it goes, tossing and separating them with a wok turner, tongs or both. When noodles are sizzling, add about half the sauce and 1 tablespoon water, and stir-fry, tossing to coat and cook through.
Step 6
Taste a noodle for doneness and seasoning. If needed, add more sauce and water, and keep cooking, turning often, until noodles are softened and savory.
Step 7
Push noodles to one side of the pan, add enough oil to lightly coat the other side, and add the eggs. Use the spatula to scramble the eggs, stirring and scraping until cooked through and just dry, 1 to 2 minutes, then stir them into the noodles.
Step 8
Add the bean sprouts and chives, and stir to combine. Serve immediately, passing the peanuts, chile powder and lime wedges to adjust seasoning to taste.
Thai sweet preserved radish, often sold already minced or shredded online and in Asian markets, delivers a tangy chewiness. For the taste you want in pad Thai, be sure to buy the dry-packed Thai variety and not Chinese or other types of preserved radish.

Using a sharp paring knife, run it around the core of the lettuce, then gently pull it out. Remove any discolored outer layers of the lettuce and discard. Tear the lettuce into large chunks. Wash the leaves and allow them to drain after gently shaking in a colander.
Step 2
In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, vegetarian stir-fry or oyster sauce, sugar and ¼ teaspoon salt. Season with pepper.
Step 3
Heat a large (12-inch) deep skillet on medium-high. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil to lightly coat the pan, then add the ginger and cook for 15 to 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the lettuce and stir-fry for 2 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Pour the sauce over the lettuce and stir-fry for another 1 to 2 minutes. (Take care not to overcook, as you want your lettuce to retain some crunch.) Taste and season with salt, if needed. Place the lettuce (and all the pan juices) in a bowl and set aside. Once your skillet is cool enough to handle, rinse it out and dry.
Step 4
To the same skillet over medium-high heat, add the ¼ cup olive oil and sliced garlic. Stir constantly for 3 to 4 minutes until the garlic turns a pale golden brown. (Watch carefully! It burns quickly.) Remove the garlic from the oil with a slotted spoon and place on a paper towel to drain; it will continue to brown and crisp as it cools.
Step 5
To the remaining oil in the skillet over medium-high heat, add the eggs and cook untouched until whites are set, 2 to 3 minutes.

1
cup/336 grams maple syrup
1
large egg
1½
teaspoons coarse kosher salt or 2¾ teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
4½
teaspoons/14 grams active dry yeast (2 envelopes)

Nonstick cooking spray","1042 user ratings","1 hour 5 minutes, plus rising ","Step 1
Make the tangzhong: In a medium pot, whisk together the bread flour and milk until relatively smooth. Set over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture thickens into a texture not unlike mashed potatoes or grits, 2 to 3 minutes. You may see lumps at first, but as you continue to whisk and the flour cooks, your mixture will smooth out.
Step 2
Make the bread: Remove the pot from the heat and whisk in the cream until smooth, which will cool down the mixture and add some necessary fat. To the creamy mixture, add 4 cups/576 grams bread flour, the maple syrup, egg, salt and yeast, and stir with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until you can no longer see any streaks of egg or flour. Cover the pot with a lid and let sit in a warm place to proof and hydrate until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.
Step 3
To knead by hand, keep ½ cup/72 grams bread flour next to you. Dust a clean work surface with some of the flour and turn the dough out onto the surface. Dust some more flour on top of the dough and on your hands, and knead the dough into a ball using both hands. As you start to feel the dough get sticky, add more of the flour. The goal here is to not use more than that ½ cup of flour to knead the dough and, at the same time, to develop enough gluten in it so that it’s no longer sticky, 5 to 7 minutes. Alternatively, knead with a stand mixer: Transfer the dough from the pot to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. Knead on medium-low speed for 15 minutes; it will become pretty sticky and cling to the bowl. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Dust some more flour on top of the dough and on your hands, and form the dough into a ball using both hands, adding more flour as needed.
Step 4
Grease a 9-by-5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Cut the dough in half with a knife, then flatten each piece using your hands, pulling the corners of each piece up and over the center, all around, so that you’re creating two tight balls. Twist the pulled-up edges to seal and turn the balls over so their smooth sides are facing up. Nestle the two balls side by side in the pan and let sit, covered with a clean kitchen towel, in a warm place in your kitchen until the dough balls have risen an inch above the rim of the pan, 1½ to 2½ hours.
Step 5
Meanwhile, heat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake the bread until the crust is dark brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center reads 185 to 190 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes.
Step 6
Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes before taking out the bread and slicing into it. (Technically it should cool completely, but come on: There’s nothing like the glorious experience of tearing into a fresh, warm loaf of sweet milk bread.) The bread will keep for up to 3 to 4 days in a closed container at room temperature.

Wipe out the same pan, and heat about ¼ cup vegetable or canola oil over medium. Drop a bread crumb in the oil, and see if it sizzles.
Step 7
Gently place croquettes in oil, making sure not to crowd the pan, and pan fry until golden brown on both sides, about 3 to 5 minutes per side.
Step 8
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and serve warm, with tartar sauce or hot sauce if desired.

1
fresh, long red chile (such as Holland), thinly sliced
2¼
pounds boneless lamb stew meat (preferably shoulder or leg), cut into 2-inch chunks

1
large bunch cilantro, leaves and tender stems finely chopped (1½ cups)
1
bunch garlic chives or scallions, green parts only, finely chopped (½ cup)
2¼
pounds spinach (about 4 bunches), stems removed, finely chopped (see Tip)

Challaw, for serving","568 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
In a large Dutch oven or similar pot, heat ½ cup oil over medium-high. Add the onion, garlic and chile, and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Push the vegetables to one side and add the lamb to the other. Cook until lightly browned on all sides, 3 to 8 minutes total. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (or 1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt or fine salt) and 4 cups water, then stir and bring to a gentle boil, skimming any scum that rises to the surface. Cover, reduce heat to low and cook until the lamb is tender, 1 hour and 5 minutes to 2 hours.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a kettle or a small saucepan, bring ½ cup water to a boil, and keep at a simmer.
Step 3
In a very large skillet with a lid, heat the remaining ½ cup oil over medium. Add the cilantro and garlic chives, and fry, stirring occasionally, to bring out all the flavors, about 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a small bowl.
Step 4
Place the same skillet over medium-high heat (no need to wash), add the chopped spinach and the just-boiled water, and cover partially. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid is gone, about 20 minutes.
Step 5
Add the lamb, 1 cup of its cooking liquid (any remaining broth can be refrigerated or frozen for another use) and the cilantro mixture to the spinach. Stir to combine well, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until all the flavors mingle, about 15 minutes. Taste, season with salt if desired and serve with challaw.
You can pulse the spinach in a food processor in batches to quickly chop it.

"Midnight Pasta With Anchovies, Garlic and Tomato","Italian,Pastas,Anchovy,Bucatini,Garlic,Linguine,Spaghetti,Tomato Paste,Dinner,Easy,For Two,Quick,Weeknight,Main Course","Yield: 2 servings","
Salt, as needed
½
pound bucatini, spaghetti or linguine
3
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
4
garlic cloves, thinly sliced
4 to 8
oil-packed anchovy fillets, chopped (optional)

Large pinch of red-pepper flakes, plus more for serving
1½
tablespoons tomato paste
½
small lemon, zested

Handful of coarsely chopped parsley or basil leaves and tender stems, plus more for garnish

Grated Parmesan, for serving (optional)","1268 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat. Add pasta and cook, according to package directions, until about 2 minutes shy of al dente so the pasta can finish cooking in the sauce. It should still have a slight crunch in the center. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.
Step 2
While the pasta is cooking, in a large skillet, combine the oil, garlic, anchovies (if using), red-pepper flakes and pinch of salt over low heat. Cook until garlic is opaque and a few of the slices are pale gold at the edges (don’t let the garlic turn brown), 2 to 5 minutes. Add tomato paste and cook until it darkens, about 1 minute longer.
Step 3
Add the drained pasta, lemon zest and ⅓ cup of the reserved pasta water to skillet. Stir until the pasta is al dente and well coated with sauce. Add more pasta water, if needed, until the sauce is glossy and the pasta cooked to taste.
Step 4
Cut the zested lemon half in half (so you’ll have a quarter of a lemon) and squeeze some juice into pasta. Stir in herbs and taste, adding more lemon juice and salt, if needed. Cut remaining lemon into wedges and serve it alongside the pasta, which should be garnished with more herbs and red-pepper flakes, a drizzle of oil and a generous sprinkle of cheese, if you like.

"Whiskey-Glazed Salmon With Salt-Crusted Potatoes","Seafood,Potato,Salmon Fillet,Salt,Whiskey,Dinner,Quick,Weeknight,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","For the Potatoes
1½
pounds baby gold potatoes, scrubbed
2
tablespoons coarse sea salt or kosher salt
For the Salmon
2
tablespoons granulated sugar
6
tablespoons whiskey
2
tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
4
(5-ounce) salmon fillets

Salt and black pepper","1078 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Make the potatoes: The potatoes should all be the same small size, about 1 inch in diameter, so cut any larger ones in halves or quarters. Place in a large saucepan with 4 cups water and add the salt. Bring to boil over high heat, then continue boiling until a paring knife slides through a potato easily, about 15 minutes.
Step 2
About 5 minutes before the potatoes are tender, start the salmon: Combine the sugar, whiskey and Worcestershire sauce in a large skillet, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Season the salmon with salt and pepper, then add to the skillet skin side down (or the flat side if the fillets are skinless). Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the salmon becomes opaque about halfway up the sides, about 5 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, carefully tip the saucepan into the sink to pour out all but about ¼ cup cooking water, keeping the potatoes in the pan. Return the saucepan to the stove with the potatoes and a thin layer of cooking water at the bottom, and set over high heat. Cook, shaking the pan often, until the liquid evaporates and the potatoes are crusted in a fine film of salt, about 5 minutes. The pan should be extremely dry and coated in salt and the potatoes will sound crackly when shaken.
Step 4
Flip the salmon and continue cooking until just opaque from top to bottom and a paring knife slides through with almost no resistance, about 5 minutes longer. If you started with a 1-inch-thick fillet, this will be medium-rare. The timing will vary depending on the thickness of your fish and your preferred doneness. If you’d like, use tongs to peel off and discard the skin if there is any. The glaze should have thickened and be syrupy.
Step 5
Divide the potatoes and salmon among serving plates and drizzle any glaze from the pan over the fish.

"Challaw (Cardamom and Cumin Basmati Rice)","Grains And Rice,Basmati Rice,Cardamom Pod,Cumin Seed,Dinner,Side Dish","Yield: 6 servings","2
cups white basmati rice, soaked in cold water for 1 hour

Salt
1
teaspoon green cardamom pods
1
teaspoon cumin seeds
½
cup sunflower or grapeseed oil","85 user ratings","45 minutes, plus 1 hour soaking","Step 1
In a large pot with a lid, bring 8½ cups water to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, drain the rice in a large fine-mesh sieve or colander and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear. Add the rice and 1 tablespoon kosher salt (or 1½ teaspoons coarse kosher salt or fine salt) to the boiling water. Boil uncovered, until the grains seem to have doubled in length, 5 to 6 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan or kettle, bring 1½ cups of water to a boil and keep at a simmer. Place the cardamom pods on a cutting board and lightly crack them with the side of a large knife.
Step 3
Drain the parboiled rice in the sieve or colander and return the rice to the pot. Add the cracked cardamom pods and any seeds that may have popped out, the cumin seeds and 1 tablespoon kosher salt (or 1½ teaspoons coarse kosher salt or fine salt). Mix gently to combine, taking care to not break the rice grains. Drizzle with the oil and the just-boiled water from the saucepan, and stir gently to coat the rice.
Step 4
Cover the pot and cook over high heat until steam escapes from beneath the lid, 3 to 6 minutes. This is a critical step in preparing the rice to avoid overcooking it. Once you see the steam, reduce the heat to low and cook until the rice is tender and all the water is gone, another 20 minutes. Serve immediately.

¼
cup/50 grams whole dried sour apricots with seeds, about 10, rinsed (see Tip)","48 user ratings","1½ hours, plus soaking and 2 days’ chilling","Step 1
Bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Place each variety of nut in a separate medium heatproof bowl and cover each variety with some of the just-boiled water. Soak the almonds and pistachios for about 1 hour, and soak the walnuts overnight (if using) to help the skins peel off. Almond and pistachio skins slip off fairly easily; walnuts take more effort. Once the skins are softened, drain the nuts and use your fingers to rub off the skins. Rinse the peeled nuts and place them all in one bowl.
Step 2
In a medium pot with a lid, bring 5 cups of water to a boil. Remove from the heat and carefully add the nuts and all of the dried fruits to the pot. Cover and set aside to cool at room temperature. Once cool, cover and refrigerate for 48 hours to allow the flavors to fully develop.
Step 3
Serve chilled, ladling some syrupy soaking liquid into each bowl. Be mindful that the senjed and whole dried apricots have seeds. Haft mewa will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
Peeling walnuts can be an arduous task, so you can leave them out and add more almonds and pistachios instead.
Senjed and whole dried sour apricots with seeds can be found at Afghan or Iranian markets, and online. They are a hallmark of the dish, but can be substituted with other dried fruits, such as figs and cherries.

Prepare the noodles: Bring a large wok (or pot) of water to a boil.
Step 2
Meanwhile, prepare the sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauces, abalone sauce, sugar and boullion powder until everything is dissolved and evenly combined.
Step 3
Cook noodles for 1 minute, then transfer to a colander. Rinse the cooked noodles with very cold water until bouncy and totally cool. Drain thoroughly and transfer to a large sheet tray. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil to prevent sticking and toss to coat. Spread noodles in a single layer and set aside. Wipe the wok dry.
Step 4
Set the wok (or a large skillet) over high heat until lightly smoking. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat. Add the onions and bell peppers, and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Let it cook undisturbed until slightly charred on one side, about 1 minute. Toss again. Add the bean sprouts and Chinese chives, and stir-fry until the Chinese chives are dark green, about 1 minute.
Step 5
Add the cooked, drained noodles to the wok and toss to combine. Keep cooking and stirring until the noodles are toasty and totally dry, about 2 minutes.
Step 6
Add the chow mein sauce. Using chopsticks, vigorously and quickly mix the noodles thoroughly until the sauce is equally distributed and the noodles are all the same shade. Plate and serve.
The bouncy texture of your chow mein demands Hong Kong pan-fried noodles; you can find them in most Asian supermarkets, refrigerated alongside other fresh noodles.

3
fresh Thai green chiles, stems removed, chopped
2 to 3
tablespoon fresh lemon juice, from about ½ lemon

Roti or store-bought pita, for serving (optional)","8 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Make a slit along the length of each melon, leaving about an inch intact on the ends. Remove the seeds and discard (see Tip 1). Rub 2 teaspoons of salt evenly on the surfaces and insides of the melons. Set aside for at least 20 minutes while you prepare the stuffing (see Tip 2).
Step 2
In a medium pot heat ¼ cup mustard oil for 30 seconds. Add onion, ginger and garlic, and cook on medium for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until translucent and fragrant.
Step 3
Add chicken and remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and cook on high, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and some bits of the minced chicken start to crisp, about 7 to 10 minutes.
Step 4
Lower heat to medium and add cumin, coriander, chile powder and turmeric. Stir and continue cooking for 30 seconds.
Step 5
Add ¼ cup water and chopped tomato. Cook on high, stirring occasionally until the oil starts to separate, about 5 minutes. Stir in green chiles and lemon juice. Turn off the heat. (The stuffing can be made up to 2 days ahead and brought to room temperature before assembly.)
Step 6
Squeeze and drain the reserved salted melon. Thoroughly rinse the inside and outside with cold water. Pat dry. (The drier the melon, the easier it will be to fry.)
Step 7
In a frying pan large enough to comfortably fit the five stuffed melons in a single layer, add the remaining ¾ cup mustard oil and heat for 30 to 45 seconds.
Step 8
Gently place the melons into the pan and shallow fry on medium until the bottom and sides are deep golden brown, but mostly brown, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 9
Place the melons on a plate lined with a paper towel to soak up any excess oil. Remove the paper towel. Using a teaspoon, stuff the melons with the stuffing. Serve with the rest of the prepared stuffing and roti, store-bought pita or by itself.
Use a potato peeler in both directions to roughly peel each bitter melon. To core the bitter melon, wedge your thumbnail between the inside lining and seed sacs, and peel like wallpaper.
The peeled and cored bitter melon should be salted for a minimum of 20 minutes and up to overnight; the longer the bitter melon is salted, the milder its flavor.

ounces/170 grams cream cheese, softened
⅓
cup/77 grams unsalted butter, softened
⅔
cup/93 grams confectioners’ sugar

Pinch of coarse kosher salt","864 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling and chilling","Step 1
Make the bars: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 9-inch square baking pan with parchment paper such that the paper spills out over the sides of the pan, like wings.
Step 2
In a food processor, pulse the pistachios until the nuts are very finely ground. Don’t let them get pasty. Add the flour, salt, baking powder and cardamom and pulse to combine.
Step 3
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together melted butter and brown sugar until smooth and shiny. (The butter will separate at first, then blend in.) Whisk in the eggs until incorporated. Add the pistachio mixture and mix with a silicone spatula to combine. Gently stir in the white chocolate chips until evenly distributed. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread in an even layer.
Step 4
Bake until the sides are brown and pull away from the pan, and the middle is slightly paler in color, 25 to 27 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center will come out with a few crumbs attached. Cool completely in the pan on a rack.
Step 5
While the bars cool, make the frosting: Finely grind the saffron threads in a mortar using a pestle or in a microwave-safe bowl using the back of a spoon. If needed, transfer the ground saffron to a microwave-safe bowl or to a small saucepan if you don’t have a microwave. Stir in the milk, and microwave on high or heat over medium until the mixture is frothing around the edges but not boiling, about 30 seconds. Place the bowl in the refrigerator or freezer to quickly cool the mixture.
Step 6
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, use an electric hand or stand mixer or a heavy whisk or wooden spoon to beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth. If working by hand, this takes some muscle. Add the confectioners’ sugar and salt and beat again until homogeneous and no clumps of sugar remain. Beat in the cooled saffron milk until well-combined. The frosting will turn a bright golden hue.
Step 7
Once the bars have cooled completely, scrape the frosting over the top, and use a spatula to spread it evenly. Crush or chop some pistachios for garnish and sprinkle all over the top.

"Tacos Dorados de Papa (Potato Tacos)","Mexican,Tacos,Cabbage,Corn Tortilla,Potato,Tomato,Dinner,Main Course,Vegetarian","Yield: 20 tacos (4 to 6 servings)","2
medium tomatoes, quartered
1
small yellow onion, roughly chopped
2
large garlic cloves, peeled
1¾
cups neutral oil, such as grapeseed oil, plus more as needed
4
medium russet potatoes, peeled and boiled until fork-tender
1
tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal), plus more to taste
½
teaspoon ground cumin
1
tablespoon nutritional yeast (optional)
6
ounces purple cabbage, thinly shredded (about 2½ cups)
1
teaspoon lemon juice
20
(6-inch) corn tortillas

Sour cream, for serving","406 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Add the tomatoes, onion and garlic to a blender, and blend until smooth.
Step 2
Heat a pot (preferably the same pot used to cook the potatoes to save on dishes) over medium and add ¼ cup of oil. Once hot and shimmering, add the blended tomato mixture. Cook until it starts to reduce and darken, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
Step 3
Add the cooked potatoes to the pot and mash with a bean or potato masher until fully incorporated with the tomato mixture and just slightly chunky, but mostly smooth. Add salt, cumin and nutritional yeast, if using, and stir to combine. Turn off the heat. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.
Step 4
Add the shredded cabbage to a bowl with the lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Toss to incorporate, and set aside.
Step 5
Heat a dry (12-inch) skillet over medium. Warm all of the tortillas on each side in the dry skillet until soft and pliable, about 1 minute, and stack in a dish towel to keep warm. Add about ¼ cup of the potato mixture to half of each tortilla and fold over to cover. Try to keep the potato mixture completely tucked inside, then place the stuffed tortilla on a tray or plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with all of the tortillas.
Step 6
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1½ cups of oil in a separate skillet over medium. Test the oil temperature by dipping an end of a tortilla to check for bubbling. Once the oil is hot, add 4 to 5 tacos at a time to the skillet. Cook the first side for 1 to 3 minutes, then gently flip and cook for an additional 1 to 3 minutes until crispy and golden.
Step 7
Carefully remove the tacos from the hot oil and return to the paper towel-lined tray or plate to drain off excess oil. Cook the remaining tacos, adding additional oil as needed and scooping out any potato bits with a slotted spoon.
Step 8
Serve immediately with sour cream and shredded cabbage.

Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1
teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Any combination of sour cream, Greek yogurt, corn chips, pickled red onion, cilantro, lime wedges or poached eggs, for toppings","698 user ratings","10 hours","Step 1
In a 5- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the beans, onion, garlic, chipotle chile and sauce, cumin, bay leaves and/or oregano, and baking soda, if using. Add 6 cups of water and 1 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Cover and cook on low until the beans are tender, 8 to 10 hours. Taste more than one bean to ensure they’re all cooked through; they should also flatten without much effort when pressed between your fingers.
Step 2
Remove and compost the bay leaves. Transfer the onion, garlic and chipotle chile to a blender or food processor, along with about 2 cups of the beans and broth. (You can purée more or less of the soup, depending on desired consistency.) Blend until smooth. Pour puréed soup back into the slow cooker, stir in the vinegar, then season to taste with salt. Eat with desired toppings.
Beans should reach a simmer and cook until tender to be safe to eat. If your slow cooker does not reach a simmer on the low setting, increase the heat level to high, and ensure the beans cook at a simmer for at least 15 minutes at some point in the cooking process.

½
cup mayonnaise
2
tablespoon capers, drained and finely chopped

Parmesan, shaved or grated, for serving

Handful of soft herbs, such as parsley or basil","882 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 450 degrees, with one rack in the middle and one at the top. Place a sheet pan on the middle rack to heat.
Step 2
In a shallow tray that will fit the chickpeas snugly in a single layer, add the chickpeas and ½ cup of extra virgin olive oil. (A 9-by-13-inch pan works well here.) Grate the peeled clove of garlic into the chickpeas. Using a vegetable peeler, peel 2 to 3 thick strips of rind from the lemon into the chickpeas. Season with ¾ teaspoon kosher salt and a good grind of black pepper, and stir. Place the chickpeas on the top rack of the oven and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, stirring once halfway through.
Step 3
Place the cabbage wedges on a plate and drizzle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil, turning them to coat. Season with salt and black pepper. Take the hot sheet pan out of the oven and add the cabbage wedges, cut side down. Add the 5 unpeeled garlic cloves to the tray. Place on the middle rack and roast for 15 minutes.
Step 4
Meanwhile, place the mayonnaise and capers into a small bowl. Cut the lemon, and squeeze the juice of one half into the bowl, and add 1 tablespoon of water. Whisk to combine. Taste and season with salt, if needed.
Step 5
After 15 minutes, remove the tray of cabbage from the oven, flip the cabbage wedges, then return to the oven. Roast for another 8 to 10 minutes, until the cabbage is golden and tender. The chickpeas should be crispy in parts and ready, too.
Step 6
Remove the tray of cabbage from the oven. (Remove the chickpeas from the oven or leave them there for a few more minutes to continue crisping while you finish the dressing.) Carefully remove the skin from the garlic, then smash them with the flat side of a knife until you have a paste. Add the garlic paste to the mayonnaise and capers, and stir. Taste and season with salt and black pepper, if needed.
Step 7
To serve, place two cabbage wedges on a plate. Top with chickpeas and some of the chickpea roasting oil. Top with Caesar dressing, Parmesan and herbs. Squeeze the other lemon half over the top and serve.
You can also use purple or savoy cabbage, but adjust time as savoy tends to cook faster.

¾
cup/102 grams all-purpose flour
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
½
teaspoon ground cinnamon
5
tablespoons/71 grams unsalted butter, cut into pieces
8
ounces/226 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (about 1⅓ cups)
⅔
cup/132 grams granulated sugar
2
cold large eggs
1
teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Sanding or granulated sugar, for coating (about ⅓ cup)
For the Filling
4
ounces/113 grams chocolate (white, milk, dark or ruby), chopped (about ½ cup)
½
teaspoon canola oil (optional)","561 user ratings","45 minutes, plus chilling","Step 1
Make the cookies: Whisk together the flour, salt and cinnamon in a small bowl.
Step 2
Place a heatproof medium bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water; don’t let the water touch the bottom of the bowl. Drop in the chunks of butter and scatter over the chocolate. Heat, stirring now and then, until the butter and chocolate are melted, but not so hot that they separate, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 3
Remove the bowl from the saucepan and whisk in the sugar. (Don’t be alarmed when the mixture turns grainy.) One by one, add the cold eggs, whisking vigorously until the mixture is thick and smooth, and the whisk leaves tracks. Beat in the vanilla, then switch to a spatula and add the flour in 3 additions, stirring gently between each addition, until the flour disappears into the dough. Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 4 days.
Step 4
When you’re ready to bake, center a rack in the oven and heat it to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Put the sanding or granulated sugar in a small bowl and, if you’ve got one, have a cork from a wine bottle at hand.
Step 5
Using a small cookie scoop or measuring spoon, scoop mounds of dough, each a scant tablespoon. Roll the dough into balls and then roll the balls in the sugar to coat. Place the balls on the baking sheets, giving them 1½ inches or so of space to spread. Press the cork into the center of each cookie or use your thumb to make an indentation.
Step 6
Bake 1 sheet for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the cookies feel firmish. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack. The indentations will have puffed in the oven, so you’ll want to press them down again. Repeat with the second sheet. Let cookies cool completely.
Step 7
Fill the prints: Melt milk, dark or ruby chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water. If using white chocolate, add oil before melting and stir until smooth. While the chocolate is still warm and fluid, use a small spoon to fill each indentation to the brim, letting the chocolate fall from the end of the spoon. Slide the cookies into the refrigerator for about 10 minutes to set the chocolate. The cookies will keep for about 5 days in a covered container at room temperature.

Season oxtails with salt and pepper. Set aside.
Step 2
In a large pot over medium, heat oil. Add the oxtails in batches, taking care not to crowd the pan, and brown, scraping the bits off the bottom of the pan, about 3 minutes per side. (You want a deep-brown crust to form on the outside.) Drain some of the oil, leaving about 2 tablespoons in the pan, and move oxtails to a plate.
Step 3
Add scallions, onions, Worcestershire sauce, curry powder, paprika, pimento seeds and thyme, and sauté for about 5 minutes until the onions are translucent. Add Scotch bonnet peppers, bouillon, tomato and browning paste, and stir for 1 minute. Add garlic and ginger, and sauté for another 30 seconds.
Step 4
Add oxtails to the pot, along with enough liquid to completely cover the meat. Bring to a boil and let simmer until tender (depending on the oxtail size and preference), about 2 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
Step 5
Once oxtails are tender, add butter beans to heat through, about 5 minutes and up to 10 or 15, if you like a more tender bean. Remove the thyme sprigs and Scotch bonnet peppers; remove the pimento seeds as you see them, or if you like. Taste and adjust seasoning, and serve hot with rice and peas, and sweet plantains.

In a large mixing bowl, combine ground chicken, ¼ cup dill, onion, carrot, rice, garlic, salt, pepper and lemon zest. Gently mix with your hands until well combined.
Step 2
Gently form the mixture into 24 meatballs, each about 1¼ inches in diameter, placing them on a plate or baking pan. Cover and chill for at least 20 minutes or up to 24 hours. This helps the meatballs keep their shape while cooking.
Step 3
In a large pot, bring stock to a boil over high heat. Reduce to medium and use a slotted spoon to carefully add meatballs to the pot. The broth should cover the tops of the meatballs by about ½ inch. If not, add a little water. Simmer gently, adjusting the heat so the broth doesn’t boil, until meatballs are cooked through and rice is tender, 25 to 35 minutes. (Break open a meatball to test it.) Remove pot from heat.
Step 4
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs and lemon juice until just mixed. Slowly add a ladle of warm broth to egg-lemon mixture, whisking constantly. Whisk in another two ladles of broth to temper the egg mixture.
Step 5
Slowly drizzle the egg-lemon mixture back into the pot with the meatballs, stirring gently so you don’t break apart the meatballs. Return the pot to medium-low heat until it just starts to simmer. (Wait for a bubble or two to appear, but don’t let the pot boil.) The broth should be silky. Remove from heat, stir in remaining ½ cup dill. Taste and add salt and pepper, if needed. (It may need quite a bit of salt if you are starting with unsalted broth.) Garnish with nutmeg, if you like, and dill, and serve.

Finely chopped parsley, for serving (optional)","1280 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Cut off the broccoli stems, then cut the stems into 1-inch-thick slices. Separate the florets into small pieces. Reserve the stems and florets separately.
Step 2
Heat a large Dutch oven or pot over medium-high and add the olive oil. Stir in the onion, carrot, tomato, sweet potato and the broccoli stems, spread in an even layer and season generously with salt and pepper. Let the vegetables on the bottom sear without stirring until lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 3
Add the garlic powder and stir with a wooden spoon to hydrate the spice in the fat and continue cooking for another minute or so. The tomato will start to break down and get jammy.
Step 4
Add the coconut water, raise the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil. Cover, lower the heat to keep the soup at a gentle boil and continue cooking until all of the vegetables are mostly softened and the stock is imbued with savory flavor, about 10 minutes. For a creamier texture, remove the broccoli stems to snack on or discard; for more broccoli flavor (and roughage), leave the stems in.
Step 5
Stir in the broccoli florets and tofu, raise the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil. Cover and cook until a paring knife easily cuts the stem part of a broccoli floret, 8 to 10 minutes.
Step 6
Carefully ladle the contents of the pot into a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed, then add more coconut water or water to thin out the soup to your desired thickness.
Step 7
Serve hot in shallow bowls, each serving dolloped with a spoonful of fridge-cold ricotta, if using, and lightly drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkled with herbs, if desired.

"Jamaican Beef Patties","","Yield: 10 patties","For the Crust
3½
cups/450 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
3
teaspoons/7 grams ground turmeric
2
teaspoons granulated sugar
1½
teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1
cup/187 grams vegetable shortening
½
packed cup/67 grams minced or ground unrendered beef suet (see Tip)
½ to ¾
cup/118 to 177 milliliters ice cold water
For the Filling
1
tablespoon vegetable oil
2
small Scotch bonnet peppers, seeded and minced
1
medium onion, diced
1
pound beef chuck, minced or ground
2
teaspoons ground allspice
1½
teaspoons ground black pepper
1
teaspoon garlic powder
1
teaspoon paprika
1
tablespoon soy sauce, preferably dark soy sauce
2
small beef stock cubes (14 grams), dissolved in 3 tablespoons boiling water","172 user ratings","1½ hours, plus chilling dough and cooling filling","Step 1
Make the crust: Whisk flour in a medium bowl, then whisk in turmeric, sugar and salt. Work in shortening and beef suet quickly, rubbing them into the dry ingredients with your fingers until the mixture is evenly crumbly. Gradually add ½ cup ice cold water while stirring with your hands to form the dough. If the dough isn’t coming together, add more water by the tablespoon as necessary. Form dough into a ball, cover with cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.
Step 2
While the dough is chilling, make the filling: Heat a large frying pan over medium, then add vegetable oil. Fry scotch bonnet peppers and onion, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add beef and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, 4 to 8 minutes. Season with allspice, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, soy sauce and the beef stock mixture. Cook, stirring, until most of the liquid evaporates, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a dish and let cool completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator. (The filling can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days.)
Step 3
When ready to assemble patties, heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove dough from the refrigerator and roll on a lightly floured work surface with a lightly floured pin into a 12-inch square. (Turmeric will stain a porous work surface. Roll between sheets of parchment paper if needed.) Fold dough in half to form a rectangle, then fold again the other way to form a square. Roll again into a 12-inch square. Repeat this process 3 more times, letting dough rest as needed if it’s too stiff to roll. Roll to ⅛-inch thickness, then use a bowl or pastry cutter to cut out 10 (6-inch) rounds, rerolling scraps as necessary.
Step 4
Divide beef mixture among rounds, spooning about ¼ cup onto one side of each round. Fold the other side of each round over the meat until the edges meet. Using a fork, seal the edges, then prick the center of each to allow steam to escape.
Step 5
Place patties on 1 or 2 baking sheets, and bake until pastry is set and golden, 22 to 25 minutes. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
Beef suet is the solid fat around cows’ kidneys and is sold whole or ground from butcher counters. Be sure to buy unrendered suet, which is solid and crumbly.

teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste
2
cups finely crushed soda crackers or plain bread crumbs (4 ounces)
1
large egg, room temperature

Vegetable oil, for frying (about 4 cups)

Lime wedges, hot sauce and saltine crackers, for serving","133 user ratings","1 hour 30 minutes, plus overnight chilling","Step 1
In a food processor, pulse the ham and onion until coarsely ground. Set aside.
Step 2
In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Quickly whisk in ½ cup flour and cook, whisking constantly, until smooth and tan, 2 to 3 minutes. While whisking, gradually add 1 cup milk, then continue whisking until the mixture thickens to the consistency of soft mashed potatoes, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the remaining ½ cup flour and use a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula to stir until very thick, firm and a darker shade of brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Some browning on the bottom of the pan is OK.
Step 3
To the pan, add the ham mixture, parsley, garlic powder and salt, and vigorously mix until the ingredients are evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a sheet pan lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper and pat into a 9-by-7-inch rectangle. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight.
Step 4
Cut the chilled paste into 21 (3-by-1-inch) rectangles, then gently roll each into a 3-inch-long cylinder. Make sure the croquetas are smooth and without cracks. Place the croquetas on the sheet pan and chill in the freezer for 30 minutes.
Step 5
Place the cracker crumbs on a plate. In a medium bowl, combine the egg and remaining ⅔ cup milk, and whisk until combined.
Step 6
Submerge 4 to 5 chilled croquetas in the milk mixture to thoroughly coat, then transfer immediately to the crackers, making sure the croquetas are coated in the crumbs. Return to the sheet pan and repeat with the remaining croquetas. Freeze again until firm but not frozen, 15 to 30 minutes. Don’t freeze for longer than 30 minutes as they may burst in the hot oil.
Step 7
Towards the end of the chilling time, fill a small Dutch oven or heavy saucepan with oil to a depth of 1½ inches. Heat over medium-high until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees. If you don’t have a thermometer, use a croqueta as a test piece: Carefully drop in 1 croqueta. If it immediately begins to fry and brown, the oil is ready. Carefully add 2 to 3 croquetas and fry, turning if needed to evenly cook, until golden brown,1½ to 2½ minutes. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels and let rest for 1 to 2 minutes before serving. Repeat with the remaining croquetas, working in batches and adjusting the heat to maintain the oil temperature. Serve immediately with lime wedges, hot sauce and saltine crackers.

½
teaspoon ground mace
1
teaspoon rose water
2
tablespoons whole milk or cream, plus more as needed

Crystallized rose petals, for garnish (optional; see Tip)","276 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Make the pudding: Butter a 7- to 8-cup heatproof pudding mold or other deep baking dish or bowl.
Step 2
Meanwhile, combine the bread crumbs, sugar, almonds, baking powder, salt, mace and rose petals in a large bowl or bowl of a stand mixer. Using an electric hand mixer or the paddle attachment of a stand mixer, mix the dry ingredients just to blend, about 10 seconds, then add the butter and beat until well combined, about 1 minute. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, lemon juice and rose water. Add to the bread mixture and beat until everything is evenly moistened, about 1 minute.
Step 3
Spoon the pudding mixture into the prepared mold; it should come two-thirds up the sides of the mold. Cover tightly with aluminum foil, crimping it around the edges to seal.
Step 4
Place the covered mold in a wide pot or Dutch oven large enough to fit it with space around and over it. Add enough water to the pot to meet the middle of the bowl. Bring the water to a boil over medium heat, then cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer. Steam, replenishing with boiling water as needed so there’s always enough to reach the middle of the bowl, until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean, 1½ to 2 hours. Cover tightly with foil again if the pudding needs to continue steaming after you insert the skewer.
Step 5
When the pudding is done, uncover the pot and let the pudding cool in the pot for about 5 minutes. Wearing oven mitts or protecting your hands with kitchen towels, grip the mold and transfer it to a heatproof work surface. If the pudding seems stuck to the mold, run a thin knife or spatula around the edges of the mold. Center a serving plate larger than the mold over the mold, then hold both tightly together and flip. The pudding should release onto the plate. If it hasn’t, tap the mold a few times, then lift off the mold. Let the pudding cool to warm.
Step 6
While the pudding cools slightly, make the icing: In a medium bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar, butter, jelly, mace and rose water. Beat or whisk until smooth, then stir in the milk. If the icing is too thick to pour, add more milk by the tablespoon.
Step 7
While the pudding is still warm, coat it with the icing. If you have any icing leftover, serve alongside the pudding. Decorate the pudding using the crystalized rose petals if you’d like. Serve warm.
If you’d like to decorate your dessert with crystallized fresh rose petals, start by purchasing organic edible roses that are safe for consumption. A day before serving your dessert, pluck ¼ cup petals from the roses. Beat 1 large egg white in a medium bowl and place ¼ cup granulated or superfine sugar in another bowl. Dip each rose petal into the egg white, then into the sugar to coat. Place on a wire rack and freeze overnight.

slices peeled fresh ginger","975 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 400 degrees.
Step 2
Squeeze ¼ cup juice from 2 to 3 tangerines into a small bowl; reserve the spent peels. Cut the remaining tangerines into wedges with their peels intact, and set aside. Add the brown sugar, soy sauce, vinegar and cayenne to the tangerine juice and whisk until the sugar dissolves.
Step 3
Generously season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. Tuck the wingtips behind the body. Stuff the tangerine peels and 6 ginger slices into the cavity, then tie the legs together using kitchen twine. Place in a large ovenproof skillet, and scatter the tangerine wedges and remaining 2 slices ginger around the chicken.
Step 4
Slowly pour the juice mixture all over the chicken, then slide the skillet into the oven. Roast for 30 minutes.
Step 5
Using a large spoon or baster, quickly and carefully coat the chicken with the pan sauce. Continue roasting, basting every 10 minutes, until the chicken is browned and cooked through, 20 to 30 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the breast should register 155 degrees and, in the leg, 170 degrees. The chicken will continue to cook while it rests.
Step 6
Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for about 5 minutes. If the pan sauce isn’t already syrupy, bring it to a boil over medium-high heat on the stovetop. Be sure to wear oven mitts or use a kitchen towel to hold the skillet (the handle is hot). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the bubbles grow larger and paler brown, and the sauce is the consistency of syrup, about 5 minutes. Discard the ginger.
Step 7
Serve the chicken whole or carved with the glaze poured all over the meat. Arrange the tangerine wedges from the pan around the bird. You can eat them, if you’d like.

cups chicken stock, preferably homemade (see Tip)
4
rosemary sprigs
1
cup pearled barley
1
bunch mature spinach or kale (remove the stems if using kale), roughly chopped","336 user ratings","About 4 hours","Step 1
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 275 degrees. Lightly season lamb with salt and pepper on all sides. Heat the oil in a 7- to 8-quart Dutch oven over medium-high until shimmering. Add the lamb shanks and cook, turning occasionally, until well-browned on all sides, about 10 minutes total. Transfer the lamb to a rimmed baking sheet or large plate, and set aside.
Step 2
Add the onions, leeks and carrots to the Dutch oven. Reduce heat to medium. Season lightly with salt and cook, stirring frequently and scraping the bottom of the Dutch oven with a wooden spoon, until the onions and leeks are as caramelized as you’d like, about 20 minutes for lightly caramelized onions that give the stew a more savory flavor, or 45 minutes or longer for deeply caramelized onions that will make the stew sweeter. If browned bits start building up on the bottom of the pot, add water a tablespoon at a time, scraping them up and reincorporating them before continuing.
Step 3
When the onions are ready, add the garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and stir until it evenly coats all of the vegetables. Add the wine, scrape the bottom and sides of the pot, and cook until the wine is reduced by at least half, a minute or two. Add the chicken stock and the rosemary. (Tie the rosemary into a bundle with kitchen twine if you want to make it easier on yourself later.)
Step 4
Return the lamb shanks to the pot. Increase heat to high, bring the pot to a simmer, and transfer to the oven. Place a lid on top, leaving it cracked by an inch or so. Cook for 2½ hours, then remove from oven. Flip the lamb, and stir the barley and spinach into the broth, making sure it’s all submerged. Return to the oven, cover with the lid cracked, and continue cooking until a metal skewer inserted into the lamb meets very little resistance, the meat falls off the bone with a little tug, and the barley is fully cooked but still chewy, 30 to 45 minutes longer.
Step 5
Transfer the pot to the stovetop, remove and discard the rosemary, and adjust the consistency to a saucy, stewlike mixture by simmering to thicken, or thin it out by adding water. Stirring as you go to prevent the bottom from sticking. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve.
When slicing the onions, remove the stem and root end, then split the onion from pole to pole. Remove the skin, then lay each half flat on your cutting board and slice them from pole to pole (to form slivers as opposed to half rings). Onions cut this way will melt into the stew more easily.
Leeks can often have sandy soil trapped between their layers. To clean them, trim and discard the root end, then cut off the dark green tops (they can be discarded or added to the pot the next time you make stock). Cut the white/pale green stalk into 2- to 3-inch sections, then split each section in half lengthwise. Run the sections under cool water, gently separating the layers with your fingers to rinse out any grit. Once clean, slice each section lengthwise into thin slivers.
This dish works best with a rich, homemade chicken stock, the kind that sets into a gel when refrigerated. If using a thinner stock or store-bought stock, pour the stock into a bowl and sprinkle the surface with ¼ cup powdered gelatin. Let it sit until the gelatin is fully hydrated, then use as directed in the recipe.
This stew can be made in advance and refrigerated for several days. It can be reheated gently in a covered saucepan or Dutch oven on the stovetop, adding water as necessary to adjust the consistency.

pound tube pasta, like rigatoni or paccheri","1531 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
In a large Dutch oven, heat 4 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Working in batches if necessary, add the cabbage wedges cut side down in a single layer, season with salt and cook until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a cutting board to cool slightly. Repeat with remaining cabbage, adding more oil as needed.
Step 2
Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and the onion to the empty pot. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and starting to turn golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Coarsely chop the cooked cabbage, including the core.
Step 3
Reserve 1 teaspoon of the garlic, and add the remaining garlic and the tomato paste to the onions. Cook, stirring constantly, until the tomato paste is a shade darker, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the wine and cook, scraping up browned bits, until nearly evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes.
Step 4
Add the chopped cabbage, ¼ cup parsley and the sugar, and stir to coat in the tomato paste. Season with salt. Add ¼ cup water, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage is soft and shiny, 15 to 20 minutes. (If the cabbage is sticking to the pot, add 1 tablespoon water and reduce the heat.)
Step 5
In a small bowl, stir the reserved 1 teaspoon garlic into the remaining ½ cup parsley. Add the red-pepper flakes, if using.
Step 6
When the cabbage is just about done, add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain the pasta.

"Bacon and Onion Pasta","","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","8
ounces bacon
2
medium red onions
¼
cup extra-virgin olive oil

Kosher salt and black pepper
8
garlic cloves
1
teaspoon red-pepper flakes
1
teaspoon herbes de Provence
1
cup sweet red vermouth (vermouth rouge)
1
pound angel hair or capellini
1
cup finely chopped fresh parsley
½
cup finely grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano","933 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Take the bacon out of its packaging with the slices still stuck together and place on a cutting board. Cut the bacon, still stacked, crosswise into ½-inch slices to create little bacon pieces, also known as lardons. Add to a large rimmed sheet pan. Halve and thinly slice the onions. Add to the sheet pan as well. Drizzle the olive oil over the bacon and onions, season with salt and pepper, and toss until evenly coated.
Step 2
Place the sheet pan in a cold oven and then heat the oven to 450 degrees. Roast until the bacon has rendered much of its fat but is still pink and the onions are slightly charred in spots but not too dark, 20 to 25 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Smash the garlic cloves with the side of your knife and thinly slice them. When the bacon and onions have had their 20 to 25 minutes, remove the sheet pan from the oven and stir in the garlic, red-pepper flakes, herbes de Provence and vermouth. Place the pan back in the oven and continue cooking until the vermouth is almost evaporated, and the bacon and onions look jammy and caramelized but not burnt, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 4
Cook the pasta according to package instructions. (Don’t overcook it, as angel hair can go from bouncy to soggy in seconds). Reserve 1 cup of the cooking liquid. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot.
Step 5
Carefully transfer everything from the pan to the pot with the cooked pasta. Add the parsley and Parmesan to the pasta, and toss until evenly combined, adding some of the reserved cooking liquid if the sauce needs thinning out. Taste, adding more salt and pepper as needed, and serve immediately.

"Spiced Butter-Basted Pork Chops","","Yield: 2 servings","2
(1- to 1½-inch-thick) bone-in pork rib chops (10 to 12 ounces each)
2
teaspoons light brown sugar

1
tablespoon neutral oil (such as canola or grapeseed)
2
tablespoons unsalted butter
1½
teaspoons smoked paprika
1
teaspoon fennel, cumin or coriander seeds, crushed

Black pepper","218 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Pat the pork dry and season all over with the sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. In a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add the pork chops, cover with a lid or baking sheet, and cook until browned on the outside and the internal temperature is between 110 and 120 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Reduce the heat if burning or sizzling wildly.
Step 2
Using tongs, stack both chops on top of one another, then grab both chops together and hold upright to sear the fat caps until crisp, about 1 minute. Lay the chops back down in one layer and add the butter, paprika and fennel seeds. Season the butter with salt and pepper. Tilt the skillet and baste the pork by spooning the melting butter and drippings over the pork until the internal temperature registers 130 degrees, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
Step 3
Transfer the pork chops to a lipped plate and pour the butter over top. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving with a spoonful of the butter.

"Country Captain","","Yield: 4 servings","2
tablespoons ginger-garlic paste (see Tip)
½
teaspoon ground turmeric
1
teaspoon Kashmiri chile powder or ½ teaspoon cayenne plus ½ teaspoon sweet paprika
1
tablespoon distilled white vinegar
2
pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch pieces

Neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, for frying
1
large onion, thinly sliced into half-moons
1
large russet potato, peeled and cut into ½-inch dice

Salt

Soft white bread, such as a Pullman loaf or Japanese milk bread, for serving","373 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Combine the ginger-garlic paste with the turmeric, chile powder and vinegar in a large bowl, then toss the chicken in the marinade to coat. Let the chicken rest at room temperature while cooking the vegetables to give the spices time to infuse the meat.
Step 2
Heat an inch of oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high until it reaches 340 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. (If you don’t have an instant-read thermometer, drop a nub of potato into the oil to test: If you get a fervent sizzle, the oil is hot enough.) Add the onion and fry, turning occasionally with a spider or slotted spoon, until the onion is soft and uniformly dark chestnut brown in color, 9 to 11 minutes. Scoop out the onion and let drain on a plate lined with paper towels.
Step 3
Bring the oil back up to 340 degrees. Add the diced potato and fry, turning occasionally, until golden brown on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Scoop out the potatoes and let drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Season generously with salt while still hot.
Step 4
While the potatoes cook, set a large cast-iron or other heavy skillet over high heat. When the pan is just beginning to smoke, drizzle in 2 tablespoons of oil from the saucepan and swirl to cover the bottom of the pan. Add half of the marinated chicken, making sure to leave space between the pieces. Let cook undisturbed until browned and crisp, 4 to 5 minutes, then flip and cook to brown the other sides, another 4 to 5 minutes. Scrape chicken and any accumulated juices onto a serving platter or bowl. Repeat with remaining chicken, cooking in 2 tablespoons oil from the saucepan.
Step 5
Add the onion and potato to the dish with the chicken. Stir gently, just enough for the juices from the chicken to gloss the onion and potato. Serve immediately with the bread.
You can find ginger-garlic paste at Indian markets, but it’s easy to make at home, too. For the 2 tablespoons called for here, chop 3 large cloves of garlic and a fat 1-inch piece of ginger, then smash them together using a mortar and pestle or continue chopping until very finely minced. Season with a tiny pinch of salt. For a larger batch, keep a 1:1 ratio of garlic to ginger and combine in a blender with salt to taste.

small butternut squash (about 1 pound 3 ounces), seeds removed, peeled and cut into 2-inch pieces
1
(14½-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
1
teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1
(1-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and grated
4
cups torn or cut fresh greens, such as kale, mature spinach, mustard greens or dandelion greens

Warm crusty bread, for serving","968 user ratings","4 hours","Step 1
Season the short ribs with a sprinkle of salt on all sides. Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven set over medium-high. Working in batches if necessary, brown the tops and sides of short ribs, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a large plate and repeat the browning process with the remaining ribs.
Step 2
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pot. Add the chopped fennel bulb, (reserve the top and fronds for garnish), shallots and garlic to the pot, season with salt, and toss to coat in the pan drippings. Sauté over medium-high heat, stirring frequently until softened, 3 minutes. Add the fennel seeds and turmeric, and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and break apart the whole pieces with a wooden spoon or other cooking utensil. Cook until the tomato juices are thickened, about 6 minutes. Return the browned short ribs, bone side up, to the pot along with any drippings from the plate. Pour in the chicken stock and bring up to a simmer. Cover and transfer pot to the oven. Braise until the meat is tender, but not falling off the bone, about 2 to 2½ hours.
Step 3
Increase the oven temperature to 375 degrees. Transfer the cooked short ribs to a plate. Using a colander or sieve set over a bowl, drain out the vegetable solids from the pot and discard, reserving the liquid broth. Skim off and discard as much oil as you can from the surface of the liquid using a spoon or a ladle. (You should have about 3 to 4 cups of broth.) Return the broth to the pot, add the potato and squash, and pour in the coconut milk. Season to taste with salt and the 1 teaspoon black pepper. Add the ginger and return the short ribs to the pot, nestling the pieces between the vegetables so that the meat is mostly submerged in the liquid. Return the pot to the oven and braise uncovered until the potato and squash are tender, the meat is falling off the bone, and the liquid is slightly reduced, 50 minutes to 1 hour.
Step 4
On the stovetop but off heat, stir in the greens: The heat from the stew should gently wilt the leaves. Top with the thinly sliced fennel top and fronds. Serve hot in bowls with warm crusty bread for dipping.

4
large eggs
1
teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously butter the bottom and sides of an 8-inch springform pan, or press a large sheet of foil into the bottom and up the sides of an 8-inch round cake pan, smoothing the sides, and generously butter the foil.
Step 2
Bring a few inches of water in a large saucepan to a simmer over medium heat. Set a large heatproof bowl over the saucepan and add the chocolate. When the chips look soft and melty, stir gently until smooth. Turn off the heat, and add the butter to the bowl. Stir gently until melted and smooth. Add the cocoa powder and stir until smooth, then take the bowl off the saucepan.

Cool in the pan on a rack, then remove the sides of the springform pan or lift the cake out of the cake pan using the foil overhang. You can slice and serve warm or at room temperature. Or, to cut very neat slices, freeze the cooled cake until firm. Slice and warm up in the microwave or oven, if preferred. Serve the cake with whipped cream or ice cream, if you’d like. The cake can be wrapped and kept at room temperature for up to 3 days, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 1 month.

Handful of cilantro leaves (optional)","479 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil. Add noodles and cook according to package instructions, stirring often, until al dente. Drain and rinse under cold water until the noodles are completely cool, shaking off as much water as you can.
Step 2
Heat a large, well-seasoned cast-iron skillet (a nonstick pan will work, too, but you won’t necessarily get the same smoky flavor) on medium-high until it is very hot, then add the noodles, 2 tablespoons of oil, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and the dark soy sauce, and, toss to coat the noodles using tongs or chopsticks. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes, mostly undisturbed, but tossing every minute or so until there is a nice char on some of the noodles. (If your pan is not well-seasoned, the noodles may stick, so toss the noodles after every minute to prevent sticking.) Remove noodles from the pan and set aside. Wipe out the pan.
Step 3
Place the vegetable stock, sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl, and stir to combine. Set aside.
Step 4
To the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon neutral oil along with the garlic and ginger, and stir for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the carrot, stir-fry for 1 minute just to soften slightly, then add the baby bok choy, stir-fry or oyster sauce, and the remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and toss. Stir the cornstarch and vegetable stock mixture, then pour it into the skillet, and stir until it comes to a boil and thickens, 1 to 3 minutes.
Step 5
Very slowly trickle the beaten eggs into the gravy in a circular motion (no need to stir). Cook the eggs until set, 30 to 60 seconds from when you start pouring. Remove from the heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper, if needed.
Step 6
To serve, place the noodles in serving bowls, and spoon a generous amount of gravy and vegetables over the noodles. Top with cilantro leaves, if using.
To replicate ¼ cup dark soy sauce using regular or light soy sauce, combine ¼ cup regular or light soy sauce with 2 teaspoons molasses.

tablespoon chopped chives, for garnish (optional)

In a small bowl, stir together the lime juice, maple syrup, mustard, garlic powder and ½ teaspoon salt. Season with pepper.
Step 2
Add the bacon and olive oil to a large, cold skillet. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the bacon is very crispy but not burned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and carefully pour all but 2 tablespoons of the fat in the pan into a heatproof dish or jar. Place the pan back on the heat.
Step 3
Pat the scallops dry with a cloth or paper towel, and season with salt on all sides. Carefully place each scallop, flat side down, into the hot fat and cook, without touching, until nicely golden brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook briefly this time until very lightly golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a plate.
Step 4
Add the brussels sprouts to the hot pan, making sure each one is turned cut side down. Season with salt and pepper and cook, still over medium-high and without touching, until brown and slightly charred on that one side, 2 to 3 minutes. Add more bacon fat as needed to keep the pan coated. Now gently shake the pan or stir with a spoon to stir-fry briefly, just a few seconds.
Step 5
When the brussels sprouts are charred on the cut sides and bright green on the rounded sides, transfer them to the plate with the scallops. In the now-empty pan, add the lime juice mixture and cook, stirring constantly, over medium-high heat until it bubbles up and reduces by more than half and a spoon dragged through the pan leaves a naked trail in the lime glaze, 2 to 5 minutes. It should look sticky like melted candy.
Step 6
Remove the pan from the heat and return the scallops to the pan, tossing in the butter as well. Stir until the butter is fully melted and incorporated into the lime glaze. This residual heat should also finish heating your scallops. Add back the seared brussels sprouts and bacon and gently toss in the glaze. Garnish with the chives.
Step 7
Serve right from the pan if you’d like with a side of crusty bread or bowls of rice.

In a heavy saucepan, whisk together egg yolks, egg and sugar. Stir in lemon juice, zest and salt. Add pieces of butter and cook, whisking constantly, over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat a spoon, about 7 to 9 minutes. An instant-read thermometer should register 180 degrees. Inspect the filling: If you think there are any coagulated bits of egg, strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean bowl.
Step 4
Pour filling into pie crust and return to the oven to bake until filling is set (it should jiggle only slightly in the center), about 18 to 40 minutes. (Pies prepared in glass and ceramic dishes can take much longer to bake than those prepared in metal dishes. Don't give up: The curd will eventually set; note that it continues to firm up after it is thoroughly chilled. It will still look liquidy in the center even when it's done. If the crust starts to brown too much before the filling is set, reduce heat to 325 degrees.) Remove pie from oven and increase oven temperature to 400 degrees for baking the meringue.
Step 5
As the filling bakes, make the meringue: Fill a medium pot with 1 inch of water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Using a large metal bowl, whisk together egg whites, sugar, vanilla, cream of tartar and salt. Set the bowl with the egg white mixture into the pot above the water, and whisk constantly by hand until sugar dissolves and mixture is warm (160 degrees on an instant thermometer) and has thickened and lightened in color, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove bowl from heat.
Step 6
Using an electric mixer, beat on medium-low speed and gradually increase speed to high, until mixture is thick and fluffy, and stiff peaks form, about 5 to 8 minutes. Be careful not to overbeat.
Step 7
Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in lemon zest. Mix with care to not deflate meringue: A few strokes should do it. Spread the meringue over the hot filling, making sure it meets the edges of the crust. Using a knife or spatula, swirl in a design, if you like, and bake until lightly browned, about 8 to 12 minutes.
Step 8
Allow to cool completely and top with more lemon zest before serving.

4
ounces Camembert, Brie or taleggio cheese, cut into wedges or large chunks
1
tablespoon sherry vinegar
1
tablespoon honey

Crusty bread, for serving","221 user ratings","10 minutes","Step 1
Quarter the radicchio head lengthwise and slice the hard white core off of each piece, then cut each quarter in half crosswise. Don’t separate the leaves.
Step 2
Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add the oil and carefully nestle the chopped radicchio into the pan, leaving it alone to sear on one side until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir for a few seconds. The radicchio leaves may separate and start to smell like roasted broccoli or kale. Immediately remove the pan from the heat so the leaves don’t wilt too much. Season with salt and pepper.
Step 3
Add the cheese, placing some pieces directly over the radicchio and others in the empty spots of the pan. The cheese will start to melt and bulge slightly. Drizzle the vinegar and honey evenly over the radicchio and cheese, and finish with a final sprinkling of salt, if you’d like.
Step 4
Serve right in the pan with crusty bread for dipping into the melty cheese and pan juices.

¾
cup/20 grams freeze-dried raspberries
1
tablespoon unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder
1
ounce bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
4
egg whites, at room temperature
1
cup/200 grams granulated sugar
¼
teaspoon cream of tartar

Pinch of salt","279 user ratings","About 3 hours","Step 1
Make the tart dough: Place the flour, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse to combine. Add butter and pulse until a coarse meal forms. Add egg and pulse just until a crumbly dough comes together. If the dough seems dry, drizzle in a teaspoon or two of water. Press dough into a disk, wrap in plastic and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight (or up to 5 days).
Step 2
Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to ⅜-inch thickness (about an 11-inch round). Place dough into a 9-inch tart pan, folding the extra dough in over the edges to build up the sides. Prick bottom of dough all over with a fork; chill in freezer for at least 30 minutes and up to 48 hours. (Cover lightly with plastic wrap if freezing for more than a couple of hours.)
Step 3
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line the tart crust with foil, and fill with baking weights or dried rice or beans. Bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and weights and continue to bake until shell is light golden, another 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool.
Step 4
Prepare the filling: In a medium saucepan, combine raspberries and sugar over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until berries break down, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove pan from heat, stir in lemon juice and use a fork or wooden spoon to mash raspberries to a purée.
Step 5
In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks and egg. Slowly add ¼ cup of hot raspberry purée to egg mixture, whisking constantly. Slowly drizzle the egg-raspberry mixture back into the saucepan with remaining purée, whisking constantly to keep eggs from cooking. Turn the heat to medium-low, and add butter and a pinch of salt to the pan. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens enough to coat a spoon, about 7 to 9 minutes.
Step 6
Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing hard on the solids, into a bowl. Allow to stand for 5 minutes, then whisk briefly to smooth.
Step 7
Pour raspberry filling into the tart shell. Bake until filling is set (it should jiggle only slightly in the center), about 14 to 22 minutes. Remove tart from oven and increase oven temperature to 400 degrees.
Step 8
Start preparing the meringue: Using a blender or food processor, blend the freeze-dried raspberries until you get a fine powder speckled with seeds. (The seeds won’t break down so don’t even try.) Set aside 1 tablespoon of raspberry powder for garnish. Combine cocoa powder with remaining raspberry powder to use for the meringue.
Step 9
Place chocolate in heatproof bowl, and melt in microwave in 10-second intervals, stirring after each, until smooth. Set aside. (Or you can melt the chocolate in a pot on the stove over low heat, stirring constantly.)
Step 10
Fill a medium pot with 1 inch of water and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. In a large metal bowl, whisk together egg whites, sugar, cream of tartar and salt. Set the mixing bowl with the egg white mixture into the pot above the water, and whisk constantly by hand until sugar dissolves and mixture is warm (160 degrees on an instant thermometer) and has thickened and lightened in color, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove bowl from heat. Using an electric mixer, beat on medium-low speed and gradually increase speed to high, until mixture is thick and fluffy, and stiff peaks form, about 5 to 8 minutes. Be careful not to overbeat.
Step 11
Sprinkle raspberry-cocoa mixture on top of meringue. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in mixture 2 to 3 times to halfway incorporate, but remains very streaky. (Do not overmix.) Drizzle melted chocolate into meringue and gently fold until just combined and still streaky. Take care not to deflate the meringue very much. (It will deflate somewhat.)
Step 12
Spread the meringue over the hot filling, making sure it meets the edges of the crust. Using a knife or spatula, swirl in a design. Bake until lightly browned, about 7 to 10 minutes.
Step 13
Allow to cool completely and sprinkle the top with a little of the reserved raspberry powder. (Save the extra to perk up oatmeal, smoothies and peanut butter sandwiches.)

"No-Churn Olive Oil Ice Cream With Hot Fudge","","Yield: 1 quart ice cream and ¾ cup sauce","For the Ice Cream
⅔
cup sweetened condensed milk (7 ounces)
2
tablespoons fruity extra-virgin olive oil (see Tip)
¾
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1½
cups heavy cream
For the Hot Fudge Sauce
⅔
cup sweetened condensed milk (7 ounces)
2
ounces bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (½ cup)
¼
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1
tablespoon fruity extra-virgin olive oil","640 user ratings","25 minutes, plus 3 hours’ freezing","Step 1
Make the ice cream: In a medium bowl, whisk together the sweetened condensed milk, olive oil and salt until well combined.
Step 2
In a separate larger bowl (or in the bowl of a stand mixer), whisk the heavy cream by hand or with a hand or stand mixer until stiff peaks form. When you lift the whisk out of the bowl and flip it over, a peak of whipped cream should stand upright without flopping over. Add a dollop of the whipped cream to the smaller bowl with the condensed milk and stir vigorously to help loosen the condensed milk mixture.
Step 3
Add the lightened condensed milk mixture to the whipped cream and, using a rubber spatula or large metal spoon, gently combine the two components by dragging the utensil under and over the mixture, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as you go. Repeat this folding to fully incorporate the cream while maintaining its air bubbles.
Step 4
Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours or overnight.
Step 5
Make the hot fudge sauce: To a small microwave-safe bowl, add the sweetened condensed milk, chocolate and salt. Microwave on high in 30-second increments until the chocolate is completely melted, 30 to 60 seconds total. Add the olive oil and stir vigorously until smooth. Alternatively, heat the condensed milk, chocolate and salt in a small saucepan over medium, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is melted, then turn off the heat and stir in the olive oil.
Step 6
To serve, let the ice cream sit at room temperature to thaw for at least 10 minutes before scooping, then top with the hot fudge sauce. The hot fudge can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days; microwave right before serving until loose enough to dollop over the ice cream. The ice cream can be frozen for up to 1 month.
Olives are fruits, and cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oils tend to taste the fruitiest. An oil made from arbequina olives and labeled “extra virgin” is an excellent option for this dessert, but many other high-quality extra-virgin olive oils will work as well.

"Hotteok (Sweet Filled Pancakes)","Korean,Pancakes,Muscovado,Peanut,Sweet Rice Flour,Snack","Yield: 10 hotteok","For the Dough
1½
cups/360 milliliters whole milk
2
tablespoons granulated sugar
1
packet/7 grams instant yeast
1½
cups/225 grams bread flour, plus more for dusting (see Tip)
1
cup/150 grams sweet rice flour
1½
tablespoons cornstarch
½
teaspoon coarse kosher salt

Vegetable oil, for greasing and frying
For the Filling
½
cup/125 grams firmly packed muscovado or dark brown sugar
½
cup/75 grams roasted unsalted peanuts, coarsely chopped
1
tablespoon ground cinnamon
¾
teaspoon coarse kosher salt","240 user ratings","45 minutes, plus 3 hours’ rising","Step 1
Make the dough: In a small saucepan over medium heat, heat the milk to about 105 degrees. (If you don’t have a thermometer, heat the milk until it feels like a warm bath — hot but not scalding). Remove from heat, stir in the granulated sugar and yeast, and whisk until the sugar has dissolved. Let stand in a warm place for 3 to 5 minutes, or until bubbling, to activate the yeast.
Step 2
In a large bowl, combine the bread flour, rice flour, cornstarch and salt. Slowly stir in the warm milk mixture until a sticky dough forms. Grease your hands with a little oil to prevent sticking and shape the dough into a ball. Transfer the dough ball to another large bowl greased lightly with vegetable oil, and cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1½ to 2 hours. Punch it down, cover again and let it rise until doubled in size again, about 1½ hours more.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the filling: In a small bowl, mix together the muscovado sugar, peanuts, cinnamon and salt. Muscovado sugar has a tendency to clump — use your fingers to squish any clumps.
Step 4
After the dough has risen a second time, dust a clean work surface with bread flour and turn the dough out onto it. Dust the top of the dough with some more flour and knead it a few times. Shape the dough into a fat, long log.
Step 5
Cut the dough into 10 equal pieces, shape each piece into a ball, set on the floured work surface, and cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Dusting with flour as needed to prevent sticking, press a dough ball into a 4-inch-wide disk using your fingertips. Make sure the disk is uniformly thick so the finished pancake will be evenly filled.
Step 6
Put the disk in your hand and slightly cup it. Spoon 2 packed tablespoons of the filling into the center of the disk. Seal the disk closed by wrapping the dough around the filling and pinching the edges together at the top. Once sealed, reshape gently to form a ball, set with the seam side down on the floured work surface and cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining dough balls and filling. (You may have some leftover filling. Sprinkle it on buttered toast or roti. Combine it with peeled, sliced apples and bake it into a pie or crumble.)
Step 7
In a large nonstick skillet, heat 3 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Put 2 or 3 dough balls seam-side down in the skillet and immediately flatten them with a spatula to a diameter of about 4 inches. Reduce the heat to medium and fry the pancakes until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip them and cook until the other side is golden brown and the hotteok feel slightly springy to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes more.
Step 8
Transfer the hotteok to a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate when done. Repeat with the remaining dough balls, wiping the skillet clean and adding fresh oil for each batch. Let the hotteok cool slightly before serving; it’s easy to burn yourself in your haste to gobble these up, as the insides are hot and oozing. Any leftovers can be cooled completely and frozen in an airtight container for up to a month. Reheat in a 350-degree oven, and re-fry in a pan with a little oil to crisp them again.
You can substitute all-purpose flour for bread flour, using 1⅔ cups/225 grams all-purpose flour.

⅓
cup/30 grams salted, roasted corn nuts, roughly chopped
2
tablespoons fresh oregano leaves","98 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/240 degrees Celsius. Add the bell pepper, tomato and yellow onion to a medium parchment-lined rimmed baking tray, and toss with 1½ teaspoons oil and a small pinch of salt.
Step 2
Arrange the peppers and tomatoes skin side up on the parchment, and roast for 22 minutes, or until softened in places. Set aside, and when cool enough to handle, peel and discard the pepper and tomato skins.
Step 3
As the vegetables cook, add the dried chiles to a medium heatproof bowl and pour over enough boiling water to fully submerge. Weigh down the chiles with a small saucer and let sit for 20 minutes to rehydrate.
Step 4
In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, a tablespoon of lime juice and a tiny pinch of salt until smooth. Set aside.
Step 5
Place a well-greased grill pan over high heat and ventilate your kitchen well. In a large bowl, gently toss together the mushrooms, red onion, 3½ tablespoons oil and ¾ teaspoon salt.
Step 6
Once your grill is hot enough, add half the mushrooms, cap side down, and half the onions. Grill the mushrooms for 5 minutes, then flip them over and grill for another 3 minutes, or until nicely charred and cooked through. Grill the onions for 4 to 5 minutes, flipping as necessary, until charred and softened (don’t worry if the layers separate further). Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining mushrooms and onions. When ready, toss the grilled vegetables with half of the cumin seeds, the remaining tablespoon of lime juice and 1 tablespoon of oil.
Step 7
Once the chiles have soaked, remove them, discarding the water. Roughly chop the chiles, then add to a blender along with the roasted vegetables, garlic, maple syrup, ⅓ cup plus 1 tablespoon/100 milliliters of fresh water, the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and ¾ teaspoon salt. Blitz until completely smooth and silky. If the mushrooms aren’t finished cooking, transfer the sauce to a small saucepan over medium heat, and gently warm through, stirring occasionally.
Step 8
Pour the warm chile sauce onto a large platter with a lip, swirling to cover the surface of the plate. Use a spoon to drizzle over the sour cream, then top with the mushrooms, onions and any remaining juices. Sprinkle over the remaining cumin seeds, half the corn nuts and all the oregano, serving the remaining corn nuts alongside.

Prepare the crust: On a lightly floured surface, and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll pie dough into a 12-inch circle, about ⅛-inch thick. Transfer to a 9-inch pie pan (not deep dish); fold the edges over and crimp them together. Prick crust all over with a fork and chill in freezer for 30 minutes until frozen. (Cover with plastic if freezing for longer than a few hours. Well wrapped, it will last in the freezer for up to a month.)

In a heavy saucepan, whisk together egg yolks, egg and sugar. Stir in the orange and lemon juices, zest and salt. Add pieces of butter and cook, whisking constantly, over medium-low heat until the mixture thickens enough to coat a spoon, about 7 to 9 minutes.

2
tablespoons heavy cream
1
sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed but still cold (half of a 17.3-ounce box)
1
large egg","1076 user ratings","50 minutes, plus 1 hour’s chilling","Step 1
Heat a large skillet over medium-high and add 1 tablespoon oil. Generously season the filets mignons with salt and pepper, and sear until the surfaces on the top, bottom and rounded sides are no longer raw, about 2 minutes total. Transfer the steaks to a plate, reserving the oil in the skillet. Brush or spread the Dijon mustard all over each filet mignon and refrigerate until cool, about 15 minutes.
Step 2
Turn the heat to medium-high, and add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add the mushrooms and shallot, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until deeply browned and no longer watery, 10 to 12 minutes. Be patient: The mushrooms will first release some water; then, once that liquid evaporates, the vegetables will start to brown. If the vegetables are sticking before they can brown, lower the heat or add a little water to the pan.
Step 3
When the mushrooms are deeply browned, reduce the heat to medium and stir in the herbes de Provence, honey, wine and cream. Let the liquids bubble up and reduce until the mixture is thick and jammy, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small dish and refrigerate until cool.
Step 4
To assemble the Wellingtons, cut the puff pastry sheet in half (it doesn’t matter which direction). Use a rolling pin or empty wine bottle to evenly roll each sheet into an ⅛-inch-thick rectangle. Mount a filet mignon-size circle of the chilled mushroom mixture in the center of each rolled-out sheet, evenly dividing the mixture between the two pastry pieces. Top each mound of mushrooms with a filet mignon.
Step 5
Carefully bring the edges of the puff pastry up and over the steaks, stretching the dough if needed to completely cover the meat. Twist the tops of the dough to seal the filling, as if you’re making dumplings. You want an even, uniform layer of pastry, so trim any overlapping dough as you go. When the tops are nicely sealed, flip the Wellingtons over, seam side down, and transfer to a parchment-lined sheet pan. You can use your hands to gently tighten each Wellington into perfectly smooth spheres. Refrigerate to chill completely before baking, at least 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.
Step 6
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a small dish, whisk the egg until homogenous and, using a pastry brush or your fingers, evenly coat the entire outsides of the chilled Wellingtons with the egg. Bake until the pastry is golden brown, 17 to 20 minutes. The internal temperature of the steak should read 120 degrees for medium-rare (it will continue to cook as it rests).
Step 7
Transfer the Wellingtons to serving plates. Let them rest for about 15 minutes before serving.

In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, add the crushed tomatoes and basil sprigs. Season the pork shoulder all over with salt and pepper.
Step 2
In a large Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons oil over medium-high. Working in batches if necessary, cook the pork until browned on two sides, 8 to 10 minutes total, adding more oil if the pan looks dry. Transfer pieces to the slow cooker as they finish. Add the sausages to the pot and cook until browned, 4 to 6 minutes total. Transfer to the slow cooker.
Step 3
Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, if needed, and the onion and garlic. Season with salt and pepper, and cook until softened, 2 to 4 minutes. Add the red wine, stirring to scrape up the browned bits on the bottom of the pot, and cook until the wine is nearly evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes. Scrape the onion-wine mixture into the slow cooker, and stir to combine. Add the meatballs on top. (It’s OK if they’re sticking out of the sauce.) Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours, until the pork shoulder falls apart when shredded with a fork.
Step 4
When you’re ready to eat, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package instructions until al dente. While the pasta boils, slice the sausage and shred the pork shoulder on a cutting board, and leave it there. When the pasta is al dente, reserve ½ cup pasta water, then drain and return the pasta to the pot. Over medium heat, toss the pasta with enough sauce to coat (about 4 cups), adding pasta water as needed until the sauce clings to the pasta. (Some meatballs might end up in the pasta pot; that’s OK.) Return the sausage and pork shoulder to the remaining sauce in the slow cooker.
Step 5
Divide pasta between bowls, then top with a bit of each meat. Pass the Parmesan and extra meat and sauce at the table.

Return the pork shoulder and sausages to the pot, along with any accumulated juices in the bowl. Nudge them around so they are submerged. Add the meatballs on top, then add enough water from the can to cover the meat. (There’s no need to stir.) Partly cover the pot, bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the pork shoulder falls apart when shredded with a fork, 2 to 2½ hours.
Step 4
When you’re ready to eat, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package instructions until al dente. While the pasta cooks, slice the sausage and shred the pork shoulder. Transfer to a platter along with the meatballs and a few spoonfuls of sauce. Reserve ½ cup pasta water, then drain and add the pasta to the pot of sauce. Over medium heat, toss the pasta with the sauce, adding pasta water as needed until the sauce clings to the pasta.
Step 5
Divide pasta between bowls, then top with a bit of each meat. Pass the Parmesan and platter of meat at the table.

ounces/142 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
For the Topping (optional)
⅓
cup/80 milliliters heavy cream
3
ounces/85 grams semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped
½
cup/48 grams sliced almonds, toasted","1083 user ratings","1 hour 10 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Make the cake: Center a rack in the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan and fit a circle of parchment paper at the base.
Step 2
Bring the butter just to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Turn off the heat and leave the saucepan on the burner to keep the butter warm while you make the cake batter.
Step 3
In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt until thoroughly blended. Add the almond flour and whisk. If the almond flour is lumpy, use your fingers to break up the clumps. Switch to a spatula and add the egg whites in 3 additions, stirring until the batter is smooth and easily flows off the spatula. Stir in the vanilla until incorporated. Add the butter in 3 additions, folding until it is completely incorporated and you’ve got a smooth batter with a light sheen. Stir in the chopped chocolate, mixing well. Scrape the batter into the pan and spread evenly.
Step 4
Bake until golden brown, evenly risen and pulling away from the sides of the pan, 37 to 40 minutes. A tester inserted into the center of the cake should come out clean. Transfer the pan to a cooling rack and leave for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the sides of the pan, flip the cake over, remove the pan, peel away the parchment and invert the cake onto another rack. Allow the cake to come to room temperature before serving or covering with ganache.
Step 5
If you’d like, make the topping: Put the cream in a small saucepan and bring just to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the chocolate. Gently stir the chocolate and cream together until blended, thick and shiny. Pour the ganache over the top of the cake and use an offset spatula or kitchen knife to spread it across the cake. Scatter over the toasted almonds. Either leave the cake on the counter to allow the ganache to set a bit (it will never be really firm) or refrigerate the cake for 15 minutes to set the chocolate. The cake is best at room temperature. Covered, it will keep for about 3 days at room temperature.

cup/118 milliliters tangerine juice (from 3 to 4 medium tangerines)

Tangerine segments, for garnish (optional)","195 user ratings","2 hours, plus at least 4 hours’ refrigerating","Step 1
Set a rack in the center of the oven, and heat oven to 350 degrees. Have 6 (4-ounce) ramekins ready. Make the caramel: Combine sugar and tangerine juice in a small skillet or saucepan. Set over medium heat, stirring to dissolve sugar, and bring to a simmer.
Step 2
Simmer, stirring occasionally, until mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Continue simmering until mixture begins to caramelize and brown, stirring or swirling the pan, 5 to 6 minutes more. Let the caramel go as dark as possible without burning, to a deep brown color, then carefully pour a bit in the bottom of each ramekin, dividing the hot caramel among them evenly. Set ramekins aside at room temperature.
Step 3
Make the custard: Put the half-and half and sugar in a medium saucepan, and set over medium-high heat. Add bay leaves, rosemary (if using) and vanilla. Bring to just under a simmer, then turn off heat. Stir to dissolve sugar.
Step 4
In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs and tangerine juice. Whisk in the hot half-and-half mixture a little at a time.
Step 5
Strain the custard through a fine-mesh sieve set over a medium bowl. Set ramekins in a deep baking dish. Fill each ramekin with ½ cup of the strained mixture.
Step 6
Place baking dish on middle rack in the oven. Add hot tap water to baking dish so it comes halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Cover dish tightly with foil and bake until custards set, 25 to 30 minutes. Start checking at 15 minutes. When done, custards should look opaque and just a little wiggly. Insert a paring knife into the center of the flan to test. The knife should come out clean.
Step 7
Carefully remove ramekins from water bath and let cool to room temperature. Wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
Step 8
To serve, run a small knife around the inside edge of each ramekin to loosen the flan. Invert a dessert plate over the ramekin, then flip plate while securing ramekin. Tap or shake ramekin, lift from plate and the flan will release. Spoon any remaining caramel around flan. Garnish with tangerine segments, if desired.

"Hoshigaki (Dried Persimmons)","Japanese,Persimmon,Snack,Fall,Winter","Yield: 24 persimmons","24
or more firm, unripe Hachiya persimmons, preferably with long stems to make hanging easy

Kitchen string, or other thin string","86 user ratings","1 hour, plus 1 month to dry","Step 1
Wash the fruit well. Remove the leaves, then use a knife or vegetable peeler to remove the peel from the crown of the fruit around the stem. Continue to peel the entire fruit, leaving the stems intact and cutting out any brown spots. Set up a rack or bar, such as a clean laundry rack, near a window with a large piece of parchment underneath. You should be able to suspend the fruit so they don’t touch one another or any other surfaces.
Step 2
Tie and sterilize the fruit: Cut a 20-inch piece of thin string for every 2 persimmons and tie the string to the stems of the persimmons using no-slip knots on both ends of each piece. Trim excess string if needed. If the stems aren’t long enough to tie, fix binder clips to the stems and tie those. If the stems aren’t long enough for that, run short bamboo skewers through the tops of the persimmons and tie the skewers. Bring a pot of water to a boil and, holding each piece of string at the center, dunk the fruit for a few seconds, then lift out.
Step 3
Hang each string over the prepared rack, so the fruit is dangling on either side of the bars, but not touching anything. Ideally, keep the rack in a sunny, dry, well-ventilated spot, either indoors or outdoors.
Step 4
After a week of drying, you can start to lightly knead the fruit every day, rolling each one gently in clean hands to help it dry evenly. Watch for any mold, which you can remove with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol, and for firm spots, which you can focus on when you knead the fruit.
Step 5
Over the course of about 3 weeks, the persimmons will shrivel and shrink, and its sugars will come up to the surface and crystallize, forming a white layer. Once the sugar is visible, you can eat the fruit or continue to dry them, and you can stop kneading them. When the fruit is firm and dark and more powdery sugar covers the surface, it’s ready to remove from the drying rack and store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month or in the freezer for up to 6 months. It tastes best immediately after drying, when you can slice and eat it as is.

6
cups chicken broth or stock
1
(14-ounce) can coconut milk

Juice of 1 lime (about 1½ tablespoons)","1307 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Warm the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion, season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and shrunken, about 8 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook, stirring, until fragrant and softened, about 2 minutes. Add the mustard seeds, turmeric, curry powder, cayenne and cumin seeds, and cook, stirring constantly, until the mustard seeds pop and sizzle, about 90 seconds. Add the carrot, celery and apple, and cook, stirring, until just starting to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste, then the flour, and cook, stirring well, to uniformly coat all the ingredients, about 2 minutes.
Step 2
Add the chicken, masoor dal and chicken broth. Season lightly with salt. Bring to a boil, stirring to scrape up any browned bits sticking to the bottom of the pot. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer.
Step 3
Cover the pot and cook for 10 minutes, then uncover and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the chicken and carrots are tender, the soup is creamy, and the flavors have blended.
Step 4
Stir in the coconut milk and squeeze in the lime juice. Serve in bowls topped with a dusting of cayenne, if desired.

Handful of parsley sprigs, plus ½ cup parsley leaves and tender stems, coarsely chopped
1½
pounds mild fish fillets of equal size (skin-on or skinless), such as cod, halibut, sole, grouper or salmon

Salt and black pepper

cup mixed, salted nuts, coarsely chopped (avoid peanuts, if possible)
⅓
cup extra-virgin olive oil
2½
teaspoons unseasoned rice wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar
½
teaspoon honey","566 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Pick a baking dish that will fit all the fish fillets in an even layer. Scatter the whole parsley sprigs in the dish. Pat the fish dry and season all over with salt and pepper. Lay the fish on top of the parsley sprigs. (The herbs keep the fillets from sticking to the pan and will lightly flavor the fish.) Pour enough boiling water around the fish to cover the bottom of the dish. Seal the dish tightly with foil and bake until the fish is opaque and flakes with a fork, about 10 minutes for thin fillets like sole and up to 20 minutes for dense fillets that are 1-inch thick or more.
Step 2
While the fish is cooking, stir together the chopped parsley, nuts, olive oil, vinegar, honey and ½ teaspoon black pepper. (Measure the pepper; it’s more than you think.) Season to taste with salt.
Step 3
Transfer the cooked fish to plates, and discard the parsley and water. Spoon some salsa over fillets and pass the rest at the table.
To steam the fish on the stovetop, pick a skillet or pot that will fit the fish in an even layer. Pour in enough water to just cover the bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to low, scatter the whole parsley sprigs and lay the fish on top. Seal tightly with foil or a lid and cook until the fish is opaque and flakes with a fork, about 10 minutes for thin fillets like sole and up to 20 minutes for dense fillets that are 1-inch thick or more.

Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Pat the chicken dry, then transfer to a sheet pan and season all over with 1½ teaspoons salt and a few grinds of pepper. In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic and rosemary with a fork. Season generously with salt and pepper.

Black pepper","786 user ratings","2 hours ","Step 1
Season the pork generously with salt on all sides. Using a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker, turn on the sauté setting (on the “more” or hot setting, if you have it). Add the vegetable oil, and, working in two batches, brown each piece of pork on two sides, about 5 minutes per side. With tongs, remove the browned pork to a plate as you go.
Step 2
Turn off the sauté setting. Stir in the leeks, garlic, lemon zest and herbs, scraping the bottom of the pot with a metal spatula. Add the milk, and continue to scrape up the browned bits. (This is important for flavor, but also to avoid a “burn” error.) Return the pork and any liquid on the plate to the pot. Season with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and a generous amount of black pepper. Close the lid and twist the pressure knob to seal. Pressure cook for 1 hour.
Step 3
Turn off the pressure cooker, and quick-release the pressure by carefully turning the pressure knob to venting. Using tongs, remove the pork to a serving platter. Remove and discard the herb sprigs. Turn on the sauté setting (on the “more” or hot setting, if you have it), and bring the milk to a rolling boil. Let the milk boil until it is reduced by about half and has darkened to a golden caramel color, about 20 minutes. (If you have time, you can caramelize it further, but take care to stir occasionally and make sure it doesn’t burn on the bottom.) Break the pork apart a little, into coarse chunks, and spoon the sauce over the top. Serve with lemon slices on the side.

Heat the oven to 425 degrees, and place a sheet pan on the oven’s lowest rack to heat. In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, lemon zest and garlic. Season with salt and pepper.
Step 2
Transfer half of the mayonnaise mixture (about ¼ cup) to a medium bowl. Stir in the smoked paprika, rosemary, red-pepper flakes and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Season the chicken all over with 1½ teaspoons salt. Add the chicken to the bowl of paprika-mayonnaise, and rub it all over the chicken. Set aside.

Halve the potato crosswise (no need to peel), then cut it into ¼-inch-thick fries. Right on the cutting board, drizzle with the olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Toss to coat.
Step 4
Place the chicken breasts skin side down on the heated sheet pan, then scatter the potatoes around the chicken in a single layer. Roast on the bottom rack for 15 minutes, then flip the chicken so the skin side is up. (No need to turn the potatoes.) Roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the fries are browned underneath and the chicken registers 155 degrees when an instant-read thermometer is inserted in the thickest part. (The temperature will rise as the meat rests.) Let the chicken rest for at least 5 minutes, then cut the chicken meat from the bones and slice. Stir the lemon juice into the remaining mayonnaise mixture. Eat the chicken with the fries and a puddle of the lemon-garlic mayo for dipping.

1
carrot, peeled and shredded (see Tip)
1
Japanese cucumber or 2 Persian cucumbers, shredded
1
small green papaya, seeds removed, peeled and shredded","212 user ratings","1 hour 10 minutes","Step 1
Make the stock: Place the yellowtail collars in a pot large enough to fit them snugly, then add the shallot, peppercorns, lemongrass, cilantro stems and 5 cups water. The fish should be completely covered. If they aren’t, add a bit more water. Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes. Turn off the heat, strain the stock and reserve the fish, setting it aside to cool. Return the strained stock to the pot, discarding the other solids. When the fish is cool enough to handle, separate the meat from the bones, return the meat to the stock and let stand off heat.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the nuoc chăm: In a small pot over high heat, bring all the ingredients to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Remove from the heat and let cool before transferring to a jar.
Step 3
Make the curry: In a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, add 3 tablespoons oil and the onion. Spread the onion out evenly in the pan and let it fry without touching it, so it gets slightly charred at the edges, about 5 minutes. Tip the onion and oil into the fish stock.
Step 4
Lower the heat to medium and add the remaining 9 tablespoons oil, the lemongrass, cilantro root and garlic. Stirring constantly, cook until tender and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the turmeric powder and stir for 15 seconds, then tip everything in the saucepan into the fish stock. To the same saucepan, add the coconut cream, makrut lime leaves and chiles, and turn the heat up to high. Use a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula to scrape up any bits of lemongrass, cilantro or garlic that may be stuck to the bottom of the pan. When the cream starts to boil, turn off the heat and let it steep for about 10 minutes. Pour the coconut cream and fish sauce into the stock, turn the heat to low and stir the curry sauce.
Step 5
While the cream steeps, prepare the noodles: Cook the rice noodles according to the package directions and drain well. In each bowl, layer noodles and fish curry, then top with a pinch of the rau răm, bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, carrot, cucumber and green papaya. Put the rest of the toppings on the table, along with the nuoc chăm, for seasoning.
When cooking with cilantro root, use as much of the bottom root as possible to make the most of its intensity of flavor. Try not to trim away anything, except for dirt, and soak the roots in water, shaking them off and giving them a good rinse to get rid of any stubborn grit

A handheld shredder, which resembles a vegetable peeler with a serrated blade, will make quick work of shredding the cucumber, carrot and green papaya. If you don’t have one, you can finely slice the vegetables with a knife.

cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed

Pickled red onion and hot peppers, pickles, lettuce, parsley, bread, mayonnaise, for serving (optional)","371 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Line a sheet pan with paper towels and set aside.
Step 2
Place the mushroom caps and stems in the bowl of a food processor and process, scraping down the sides, until the mushrooms are finely minced into something of a paste, almost resembling ground meat. (You can also mince as finely as possible with a knife.)
Step 3
Transfer the minced mushrooms to a large bowl. Add the parsley, garlic, salt, turmeric, oregano and pepper, and stir to combine. Add the flour and stir to combine. Beat in the eggs one at a time, stirring until the eggs are well combined and the batter has the consistency of loose yogurt.
Step 4
In a large pan with a lid, heat the oil over medium-high. Reduce the heat to medium, and dip two spoons in the hot oil so they're slightly greased up. Using the spoons, drop two tablespoons of batter into the oil to make one patty. With the back of a spoon, even out and shape the patty into an oval as best as you can. Repeat with as many patties as you have room for in the pan. Cover and cook the patties on one side until you see the edges setting and crisping up, about 5 minutes. (You should hear sizzling sounds.) Very carefully lift the lid so you don’t get splattered, and use a spatula and spoon to flip the patties. Cover and cook until the other side is golden brown and the patties are cooked through, about 5 minutes.
Step 5
Transfer to the prepared sheet pan and repeat with any remaining batter, adding more oil if needed.
Step 6
Serve the mushroom patties hot or at room temperature with trimmings.

In a large bowl, combine 1 cup panko, the milk, egg, garlic powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir together and let sit for 5 minutes.
Step 2
Add the chicken and ¾ cup Parmesan. Stir with your hands until combined, avoiding overmixing. Roll into 24 balls about the size of a golf ball (about 2 tablespoons each) and place on a sheet pan or plate. In a medium bowl, stir together the remaining ¾ cup panko and ¼ cup Parmesan. Toss each meatball in the panko-cheese mixture, pressing gently to adhere. (To avoid a big mess, designate one “wet hand” for touching the meatballs and one “dry hand” for tossing in the panko.) Refrigerate for 5 minutes.
Step 3
In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil over medium. When foaming, add half the meatballs. Cook, turning often and reducing the heat if needed to prevent burning, until golden brown and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate.
Step 4
Reduce the heat to medium-low and remove any dark oil or loose panko from the skillet with a spoon or paper towel. (The skillet will be hotter at this point, so reducing the heat ensures even cooking for both batches.) Add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon oil. When foaming, add the remaining meatballs and cook, turning often, until golden brown and cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer to the plate.

tablespoons/35 grams unsalted butter, at room temperature
⅓
cup/40 grams tapioca starch
1
large egg

Canola oil, for greasing pan","154 user ratings","2 hours, plus overnight chilling","Step 1
Combine the glutinous rice flour and ¾ cup/180 grams water in a bowl to form a dough. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.
Step 2
Heat oven to 400 degrees. Wash and scrub the sweet potatoes and pat them dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen towel. With a fork, poke holes all over the sweet potatoes. Bake on a foil-lined pan until a fork can pierce it with no resistance, 40 to 50 minutes.
Step 3
When cool enough to handle, peel off the skin. Pass the sweet potato through a ricer or mash with a fork. Measure out 1¼ cups/320 grams of the mashed sweet potato. (Reserve any remaining for another use.)
Step 4
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 5
Combine coconut milk, sugar and salt in a large saucepan. Set the saucepan over medium-low heat, and whisk until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is hot but not boiling, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the butter, stirring until it melts. Mix in the sweet potato mash, followed by the tapioca starch, then add the refrigerated wet glutinous rice flour gradually in chunks, whisking as you go. Add the egg and whisk until smooth.
Step 6
Heat 1 or more kuih bahulu pans in the oven until very hot, 7 to 8 minutes. If you don’t have a kuih bahulu pan, a decorative cakelet pan or mini muffin tin made out of cast iron or aluminum works (see Tip). The batter yields 24 to 42 nian gao, depending on the size of the hollows; work in batches if needed (see Tip). Remove the pan from the oven and, using a silicone or pastry brush, lightly and quickly brush its hollows with oil. Stir batter, then quickly pour it into the hollows, filling them 80 to 90 percent full.
Step 7
Bake on the center rack until golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center of one emerges moist and sticky, but with no pasty raw batter on it, 20 to 40 minutes. The exact baking time will vary depending on the size and heft of your pan.
Step 8
Use a wooden skewer or butter knife to pry out and remove the nian gao from the pan. If the pan was properly heated and oiled, the nian gao will not stick. If needed, repeat with the remaining batter. If the pan cools off too much while you are removing a batch of nian gao, heat it for a couple of minutes in the oven before baking the next batch.
Step 9
These nian gao are best served slightly warm while the edges are still crisp and the centres are soft and chewy. They are best the same day they are made. You can keep leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator and steam, pan-fry or microwave them to reheat the next day, but they will not completely recover their freshly cooked texture.
These are traditionally made in brass kuih bahulu pans, but this recipe can be made in oven-safe cast iron molds, takoyaki pans, tartlet molds or mini muffin tins. Decorative cakelet pans are also great because they’re festive. The batter bakes more quickly in thicker metal pans, which also yield a darker crust.

Add the pandan leaves, chile powder, ground coriander, ground turmeric, ground fennel and remaining 1 teaspoon white pepper, and stir until it smells lovely, about 10 seconds.
Step 4
Add the chicken and stir until it is completely coated with the aromatics. Pour in the chicken broth, and bring the mixture to a near boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover and gently simmer until the chicken is tender and cooked through, 15 to 18 minutes. Stir in the coconut milk and simmer briskly to concentrate the flavors, 5 to 8 minutes. Add salt to taste. Turn off the heat and use the curry to prepare nasi biryani.

Prepare the biscuits: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar, salt and baking soda.
Step 2
Using a pastry cutter or your hands, cut or rub in the butter until mixture resembles rolled oats. Fold in the buttermilk and scallion. Gently stir mixture until it comes together in a moist, sticky mass. Cover bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.
Step 3
Heat oven to 425 degrees.
Step 4
Start the chili: In a large ovenproof skillet, heat oil over high heat until it thins. Stir in turkey and cook, breaking up meat with a wooden spoon, until it’s no longer pink with some browned bits, about 7 minutes.
Step 5
Reduce heat to medium-high, and add onion and jalapeño, and cook until translucent and tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, chili powder, 1 teaspoon salt, oregano, cumin and pepper, and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute longer.

Using kitchen shears or your hands, break up tomatoes and add them, along with the juices, to the pan. Add beans and remaining ½ teaspoon salt, and scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes. If the mixture seems very dry, add a few tablespoons water. It should be juicy-looking but not wet. Remove from heat and stir in cilantro. Taste and add more salt, if needed.

Divide biscuit dough into 6 equal balls. Use your palm to flatten each ball into a ¾-inch-thick disk. Arrange on top of turkey chili. Brush biscuits lightly with milk, and sprinkle grated Parmesan on top. Transfer skillet to oven and cook until biscuits are golden at the edges, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Serve with sour cream and pickled jalapeños, if you like, and more scallions.

Heat an air fryer to 350 degrees using the air crisp feature. In a shallow plate, mix both bread crumbs with the Parmesan and Italian seasoning. In a bowl, whisk the eggs.
Step 2
Dip each piece of chicken in the egg, coating it evenly, and let excess egg drip off. Then press into the bread crumb mixture to evenly coat. Place the prepared chicken in the air fryer in a single layer. You may need to cook in batches. If you do, heat an oven to 200 degrees.
Step 3
Cook until the crust turns deep brown, 7 to 8 minutes. The timing depends on the air fryer. Spread 1 to 2 tablespoons marinara over each breast, then sprinkle with mozzarella. Cook until the cheese melts and the chicken cooks through, an additional 4 to 5 minutes. If cooking in batches, keep the first batch warm in the oven while preparing the next.

¼
cup fermented soybean paste (taucheo) or Korean doenjang

tablespoons oyster sauce (vegetarian, if preferred)
2
red fermented bean curd cubes (furu; see Tip), or 2½ tablespoons red miso paste

pounds green cabbage, cut into 2-inch-thick pieces, leaves separated
2
large carrots, peeled and cut into matchsticks
1
tablespoon palm sugar or dark brown sugar, plus more to taste
1
teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste

Cilantro sprigs, for garnish","275 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
In a large heatproof bowl, cover the dried mushrooms with 4 cups boiling water. In a medium bowl, combine the glass noodles with enough room temperature water to cover. Soak both for 30 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the sauce: Combine the fermented soybean paste, oyster sauce, bean curd cubes and soy sauce in a small bowl. Mash the bean curd cubes with a fork, and mix thoroughly to form a paste. Set aside.
Step 3
Lift the mushrooms out of the water and into a fine-mesh sieve, reserving the soaking water. Squeeze out excess water from the shiitake mushrooms, then trim the shiitake stems and discard. Thinly slice the shiitake caps. With a knife or scissors, trim and discard any tough, craggy bits from the wood ear mushrooms. If they’re larger than 2 inches in diameter, cut them in half. Drain the glass noodles and set aside.
Step 4
Set a large wok or large Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add the peanut oil. When the sides of the wok begin to smoke, slide in half of the dried tofu skin and fry until light golden brown, 20 to 30 seconds. Transfer the fried tofu skin to a paper towel. Repeat with the remaining dried tofu skin. Reserve the oil in the wok and reduce the heat to medium-low.
Step 5
When the reserved oil is shimmering, add the shallots and garlic. Cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sliced shiitake mushrooms and cook for 30 seconds. Add the sauce, and toss in the cabbage. Quickly stir to combine so that the sauce completely coats the cabbage. Pour in the reserved mushroom water, leaving behind any grit, and turn the heat up to high. When the mixture begins to bubble, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the wok. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage has wilted completely, about 10 minutes.
Step 6
Add the wood ear mushrooms, glass noodles, fried tofu skin and carrots. Mix, cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the cabbage has absorbed all the liquid and is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. The dish is done when there is no more liquid pooled at the bottom. Turn off the heat, then stir in the palm sugar and salt, adding more to taste if you’d like. Transfer to a deep serving dish and garnish with cilantro. Serve immediately.
Red fermented bean curd cube is tofu preserved in rice wine and yeast. It has a creamy, cheeselike quality to it— like a mild Brie. It is sold in Chinese grocery stores and usually packaged in small jars.
Tofu skin, sometimes labeled beancurd stick or yuba, is the thin film that forms on top of fresh soy milk. It can be found in most Asian grocery stores and is sold in both dried and fresh forms. For this recipe, it is important to buy the dried version.

"Sambal Belacan ","","Yield: Makes about ¼ cup","½
ounce/15 grams belacan, also known as dried shrimp paste (about ¼-inch slice; see Tip)
3
Holland chiles or other fresh red chiles
1
fresh makrut lime leaf, stem and rib removed
¼
teaspoon granulated sugar, plus more to taste

Salt (optional)
2
calamansi limes or 1 regular lime, quartered","53 user ratings","10 minutes ","Step 1
Belacan has an intense aroma, so it is best to open a window or turn on the stove’s exhaust fan to its highest setting when toasting it. Toast the belacan in a frying pan over medium heat, using the back of a spatula to rub it against the surface of the pan. Stir and continue to toast until it is brittle and lightens in color, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and reserve.
Step 2
Seed the chiles if you prefer a milder sauce. Finely chop the chiles. Transfer the chiles and makrut lime leaf to a mortar, and grind with a pestle until blended. Stir in the toasted belacan and continue to pound until you obtain a fine, dark paste. If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, pulse the ingredients with a small blender or food processor to form a chunky purée. Use a spatula to keep pressing down the paste as you blend to make it smoother.
Step 3
Add sugar and salt to taste. Sugar helps tone down the pungency; salt is optional and usually unnecessary. The sauce should be a balance between savory and spicy. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When ready to serve, squeeze the limes into the sambal and mix well.
Belacan can be purchased online or in Southeast Asian specialty stores, and is usually sold in brick form. Because every brand of belacan tastes a bit different, it is best to season the sauce with sugar and salt to taste.

Cilantro sprigs, for garnish

Sambal belacan, for serving (optional)","507 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook just until tender, 1½ minutes. Drain well, rinse under water and drain again.
Step 2
Whisk the eggs in a bowl and add a pinch of salt. Brush ½ teaspoon oil on a nonstick frying pan and set over medium-low heat. When the oil is hot, pour in the eggs and tilt the pan so that the eggs form a thin and even film. Cook until firmly set, 4 to 5 minutes. With a spatula, ease the omelette off the pan and flip onto a cutting board. When the omelette is cool enough to handle, gently roll it and slice into thin strips, cutting longer strips in half.
Step 3
Heat a large wok or very large skillet over medium-high and add the remaining ¼ cup oil. Add half of the sliced shallots and continuously stir until they are crispy and light golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer the fried shallots using a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined plate, and save for garnish.
Step 4
Heat the wok with the oil over medium and add the fermented soybean paste, garlic, and remaining shallots. Stir until the mixture is fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the pork, shrimp and 1 cup chicken broth. Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil.
Step 5
Add the mustard greens, lo mein noodles and bean sprouts. Toss well to combine, and cook until the pork and shrimp are cooked through, about 3 minutes. There should barely be any broth left, but if you prefer a soupier consistency, add up to 1 cup more stock. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and the white pepper, then taste and season with more if you’d like. Transfer to a serving platter.
Step 6
To serve, garnish with the egg strips, fried shallots, chiles and cilantro. The noodles are best enjoyed with a side of sambal belacan.
If you cannot find fresh lo mein noodles, cook 14 ounces dried lo mein noodles according to packet instructions.

Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Put the crackers in a medium bowl and use your hand to crush them until they are finely crushed. (Some coarser bits are OK.)

Put the fish fillets in a large, ovenproof skillet. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon butter over the fish and turn to coat. Season the fish on all sides with salt and pepper. Mound the cracker mixture on top of the fish, covering it. (Some cracker crumbs will fall off the fish.)
Step 3
Roast in the oven for 10 to 16 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Plan for about 10 minutes per inch; the fish should flake easily, and the juices should be bubbly around the edges. Squeeze the lemon juice over the top. Sprinkle with paprika, and serve with extra lemon wedges on the side.

1
teaspoon oyster sauce
1
teaspoon scallop powder mixed with water to make a thin paste, or 1 teaspoon fish sauce
1
tablespoon soy sauce","116 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes, plus overnight soaking","Step 1
The day before cooking, submerge the garlic in the oil in a small container. Cover and refrigerate overnight.
Step 2
When ready to cook, check the fish for any remaining scales and scrape off, paying special attention to the head and tail. Rinse the fish and pat dry.
Step 3
Boil the somen according to the package instructions, rinsing and draining well. While the noodles are still damp, arrange them on a serving platter and cover with plastic wrap.
Step 4
Loosely toss together the celery, carrot, scallions, onion and cilantro leaves in a small mixing bowl. Set aside at room temperature (if refrigerated, the hot oil added at the end won’t sizzle). In another small bowl, mix the chung choi, ginger and cilantro stems, and stuff ½ cup of the mixture inside the fish cavity, including the head. Pat the remaining few tablespoons over both sides of the fish’s body.
Step 5
Set a steamer rack or other metal rack inside a wok or roasting pan large enough to accomodate the fish and set on the stove, straddling two burners if needed. Have ready the wok’s lid or sheets of foil large enough to cover the roasting pan tightly. Add enough water to come up to the rack (1 to 1½ inches). Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
Step 6
Meanwhile, stack 2 sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil large enough to hold the fish. Turn up and crimp the foil at the edges to create a boat just large enough to fit the fish. The raised edges will catch the drippings, which will make the sauce. Put the foil boat on the rack over the boiling water, then lay the stuffed fish on the foil. Cover with a lid or tightly with foil and let steam for 15 to 18 minutes (6 minutes per pound). Don’t lift the lid to check on the fish, as this will cause the temperature to drop. Adjust the temperature as needed if the lid begins to clatter. Uncover and check to see if the fish is done: The eyes should be white and bulging, the mouth slightly agape and a chopstick inserted into the flesh should slide in easily. Turn off the heat.
Step 7
Using two long spatulas, gently transfer the fish to the somen platter, laying it on top of the noodles. Lift the foil boat out of the steamer, careful not to spill any sauce, and pour the sauce into a small bowl. Add the oyster sauce and scallop powder (or fish sauce) and stir. Pour the sauce over the fish, then cover the fish with the vegetable and herb garnish.
Step 8
Pour the reserved garlic oil into a small saucepan. Heat over high until the garlic turns golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat and discard the garlic. Slosh the soy sauce over the garnished fish, then carefully pour on the hot garlic oil, letting it sizzle. Serve immediately.
When buying whole fish, make sure the eyes are clear and the flesh is firm.
Chung choi is salted preserved turnip, dark brown in color and often wound into a ball with its leaves. In Hawaii, it is sold in most supermarkets and elsewhere, it is sold in Asian markets. Salted preserved mustard greens, also available at Asian markets and online, can be substituted. You also can make a quick, fresh version by finely chopped mustard greens, tossing with a very generous pinch of salt and letting it sit overnight in the refrigerator, alongside the garlic oil. Squeeze dry before using.

Use a muddler or the end of a rolling pin to muddle the mixture together, working the sugar mixture into the peels until the peels begin to express their oils and start to turn slightly translucent. Set aside at room temperature for at least 6 hours or overnight. Much of the sugar should be dissolved, and the citrus peels will be mostly translucent.
Step 3
Juice the reserved lemons and grapefruit. (You should have about 1¼ cups juice.) Add the juice to the mixture and stir (or cover and shake the jar) until the sugar and salt dissolve. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer, pressing on the solids and transfer to an airtight container. The shrub can be stored, in the refrigerator, for up to 1 month.

cup thinly sliced shallots, leeks or onion
1
cup mascarpone or crème fraîche
1
cup chopped parsley leaves and tender stems, chives, mint or cilantro
8
ounces shredded Gruyère (about 1⅔ cups)

Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)","672 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a medium pot of well-salted water to a boil over high heat.
Step 2
Add farro to the pot, and cook according to package directions until tender (which should be about 20 to 30 minutes). Drain well in a colander. While still warm (and leaving the farro in the colander, if you like), drizzle the grains with enough olive oil to coat lightly, tossing well to prevent from sticking. Set aside.
Step 3
While farro is cooking, prepare the mushrooms: In a large ovenproof skillet, heat 3 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high until hot but not smoking. Add enough of the mushrooms to cover the skillet in one layer without crowding and half the thyme. Cook, undisturbed, until bottoms of the mushrooms are golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir and let brown on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes more. Use a slotted spoon to transfer mushrooms and thyme to a plate, and season with salt and pepper. Add another 2 tablespoons oil to the pan and repeat with another layer of mushrooms and thyme, adding them to the plate when done. Repeat with any more mushrooms if necessary.
Step 4
Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to skillet and stir in shallots and a large pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté until tender and golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
Step 5
Remove skillet from heat and return mushrooms to the pan (discarding the thyme sprigs). Stir in farro, mascarpone and ¾ cup parsley. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if needed. Spread mixture evenly in the skillet and sprinkle Gruyère on top. Bake until the farro is hot and Gruyère is melted, 10 to 15 minutes. Turn on broiler and broil for 1 to 2 minutes until Gruyère starts to bubble and develop brown spots.
Step 6
Sprinkle with remaining parsley and serve with lemon wedges for squeezing on top, if you’d like.

Whisk together the polenta, roasted red peppers, marinara, garlic, olive oil, oregano, garlic powder and 1 teaspoon salt in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker. Whisk in 5½ cups of water. Cook on low for 6 hours. (The polenta will keep very well on warm.)

About 10 or 15 minutes before you want to eat, heat the oven to 450 degrees. Lightly coat an oven-safe skillet with olive oil, and roast the sausages in the skillet in the oven until sizzling and browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the skillet and put it over medium-high heat on the stovetop. Add a little more oil if the pan is relatively dry. Add the capers and pepperoncini to the hot skillet with the sausages, and let the capers pop, 1 or 2 minutes. Turn off the heat.
Step 3
Stir the Parmesan into the polenta. The polenta will continue to firm up as it cools; stir in a few tablespoons of water if you would like it to be looser. Serve the polenta in shallow bowls topped with sausages, capers and pepperoncini. Pass more Parmesan at the table.

Place a sheet pan on the middle oven rack and heat to 450 degrees.

In a large bowl, combine the rice with salt, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, sesame oil and half of the diced onion. Toss to combine well. Remove the sheet pan from the oven, and spread the rice out evenly. Bake for 15 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a medium saucepan on medium-high heat, add 1 to 2 tablespoons neutral oil and the remaining diced onion. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes until the onions start to soften, then reduce heat to medium and cook for 2 minutes more until translucent. Add the remaining 6 to 7 tablespoons neutral oil, along with the mushrooms, garlic, ginger, remaining 1 tablespoon soy sauce, dark soy sauce and red-pepper flakes.

2

2
teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
1½
teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1
packed teaspoon dark brown sugar
½
teaspoon garlic powder
¼
teaspoon citric acid (optional; see Tip)","596 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Make the chicken wings: Heat oven to 400 degrees and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. On the sheet pan, pat the chicken wings dry, and toss with the olive oil and salt until evenly coated.
Step 2
Roast until the chicken skin is golden brown and crispy, turning once halfway through, 30 to 40 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the lemon pepper: Finely grate about 2 teaspoons zest from the lemons onto another parchment paper-lined pan (a considerably smaller one works). Cut the lemons into wedges and set aside for serving. Add pepper to the zest, mix to combine and spread in an even layer. When the wings are done roasting, transfer them to a large mixing bowl and turn off the oven. Place the pan with the lemon zest and black pepper in the still-warm oven, letting the lemon zest dry out and the black pepper toast in the residual heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Be careful not to burn or brown the zest; it may darken in shade slightly but should still be a vibrant yellow.
Step 4
In a small bowl, use your fingers to mix together the toasted lemon zest and black pepper with the salt, brown sugar, garlic powder and citric acid (if using) until well combined. Be sure to break up any clumps of sugar. Sprinkle 4 teaspoons of the lemon pepper over the wings and toss until evenly coated. Taste for seasoning, adding more lemon pepper as desired. (You can store the rest of the spice blend in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for up to 1 month.)
Step 5
Transfer the seasoned wings to a large platter and garnish with the lemon wedges. Serve immediately.
Citric acid is the secret ingredient in most commercial lemon-pepper seasonings. An organic compound found in lemons and other citrus fruits, it is sold powdered (sometimes as sour salt) in the baking and spice aisles of supermarkets as well as online. It gives you an electric tartness without fresh juice. But if you don’t want to go this route, be sure to spritz the chicken wings with the lemon wedges right before serving (and do this anyway, even with the citric acid, as the sharpness is exhilarating).

tablespoons nonpareil capers, drained and patted dry
2
lemons
¼
lightly packed cup/10 grams finely chopped fresh chives","477 user ratings","2½ hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit/180 degrees Celsius.
Step 2
Add 2 tablespoons/30 grams of butter and all the oil to a medium (10-inch/26-centimeter) ovenproof sauté pan over medium-high heat. Once melted, add the onions and ½ teaspoon salt, turn the heat down to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are softened and have taken on a light coloring, about 15 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme leaves, and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant. Stir in the miso and wine, and cook until liquid is reduced by half, about 4 more minutes. Remove from the heat.
Step 3
In a large bowl, very gently toss together celery root (celeriac), potatoes and flour with 1½ teaspoons salt and a generous grind of pepper. Stir in the onion mixture to coat, then transfer everything back into the skillet, piling the vegetables haphazardly, so that the batons are pointing in different directions. Pour in the stock. Lightly grease a piece of foil with a little oil, then tightly cover the pan (oiled side down) and bake for 1 hour, or until the vegetables have cooked through.
Step 4
Remove the foil, and turn the oven temperature up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/210 degrees Celsius. Sprinkle over the Gruyère and return the dish to the oven for 30 minutes, or until nicely browned on top, rotating the dish halfway. Leave to settle for at least 20 minutes while you make the brown butter (beurre noisette).
Step 5
Add the remaining butter and the thyme sprigs to a small saucepan, and place it over medium heat. Once melted, cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until it starts to smell nutty (add more or less time if necessary). Add the capers (carefully, as they might spit) and cook for 4 more minutes, or until they darken and burst. Off the heat, stir 1 tablespoon lemon juice from 1 lemon, chives and another good grind of pepper.
Step 6
Pour the caper brown butter all over the top of the gratin and serve warm, with the remaining lemon sliced into wedges to squeeze alongside.

In a large bowl, stir together the chicken, half the Parmesan, half the garlic, the egg and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir with your hands until combined. Using wet or oiled hands, roll into 12 to 14 meatballs (about 1½ inches in diameter each). Meatballs will be very soft, but if they don’t hold their shape, refrigerate until Step 3.

In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the oil, tomato paste, remaining garlic and the red-pepper flakes (if using) over medium. Cook, stirring, until the garlic is sizzling and fragrant and the oil is stained red, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken broth, marinara sauce and 2 cups of water. Keep on medium heat and bring to a simmer.
Step 3
Gently add the meatballs to the broth and stir to combine. Add the spaghetti. Simmer over medium, stirring gently and often, until the meatballs are cooked through and the pasta is al dente, 10 to 12 minutes. (Pasta will finish cooking from the heat of the soup).

Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Step 2
Place the meat in a large bowl and spread it out, creating a flat surface, to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. Sprinkle the salt, dried mint (if using), pepper and turmeric evenly over the meat. Add the grated onion and garlic, and mix everything well with your clean hands. Set a small bowl of warm water next to you, and wet your palms a little so the meat doesn’t stick to your hands. Roll the meat mixture into 1½-inch balls (the size of a sparrow’s head), about 1 tablespoon of meat mixture per meatball. (You should have around 25 to 30 meatballs.) Place the meatballs on the prepared sheet pan, drizzle with the olive oil and bake until cooked through and slightly browned on top, about 20 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the sauce: In a medium sauté pan or pot with a lid, heat the oil over medium-high, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the onion with a little salt, reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic and turmeric. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the garlic and turmeric are fragrant.
Step 4
Add the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, stir, and cook for 2 minutes just to take the raw edge off. Push the potatoes to the sides and make a little space in the middle of the pot. Add the tomato paste to the oil in the center, stirring to cook off its raw taste and deepen the color, and taking care not to burn it, about 1 minute. Mix the tomato paste with the potatoes, add 1½ cups of water, stir and bring to a gentle boil. Add the meatballs, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.
Step 5
Taste the sauce and a potato, and adjust seasonings to your liking. Add the cinnamon, gently stir, cover and cook for another 5 minutes, until all the flavors have melded. You can add more water if you’d like a slightly thinner sauce.

For the Glaze (optional)
1
cup/120 grams confectioners’ sugar
1 to 2
tablespoons lemon juice
½
teaspoon poppy seeds, for sprinkling","1437 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Make the cake: Center a rack in the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Butter and flour an 8½-inch loaf pan. Place the pan on 2 stacked baking sheets or an insulated baking sheet.
Step 2
Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt in a small bowl. Put the sugar in a large bowl, add the lemon or tangerine zest, and rub together with your fingers until the sugar is moist and aromatic. Add the eggs, one by one, whisking each vigorously before adding the next. Whisk in the juice and vanilla, and then whisk in the heavy cream until smooth.
Step 3
Add the flour mixture in 3 additions, using the whisk to gently stir the dry ingredients into the batter. When the flour is incorporated, add the butter in 2 additions, again stirring gently with the whisk. You should have a thick, smooth, shiny batter. Switch to a flexible spatula and stir in the poppy seeds. Scrape the batter into the pan.
Step 4
Bake until the cake has risen and cracked along the center and, most important, a tester inserted deep into the cake comes out clean, 60 to 70 minutes. Take a look at it after about 45 minutes and tent it loosely with foil if it’s getting too dark too fast.
Step 5
Transfer the pan to a rack, cool for 5 minutes, and then run a table knife between the cake and the sides of the pan. Unmold the cake, then turn it right side up onto the rack. Cool to room temperature.
Step 6
Make the glaze, if you like: Stir together the confectioners' sugar and 1 tablespoon lemon juice until smooth. If needed, add more juice, a drop at a time, until you have an icing that falls slowly from the tip of a spoon. Spread it over the cooled cake to coat evenly, sprinkle with poppy seeds and let stand until set. Wrapped well, the cake will keep at room temperature for about 4 days; unglazed, it can be frozen for up to 1 month.

teaspoon orange blossom water
3
cups/330 grams confectioners’ sugar
2
tablespoons whole milk or heavy cream

Purple, gold and green sparkling sugar or edible glitter sprinkles, for decorating","302 user ratings","6 hours","Step 1
Make the filling: Place the apples, brown sugar, flour, butter, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ½ cup water in a large saucepan and stir well. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring frequently, until the apples are completely softened but still retain their shape, about 25 minutes. Watch carefully near the end and stir as the mixture will begin to stick to the pan as it caramelizes. Set aside.
Step 2
While the apples cook, prepare the dough: In a small bowl, mix yeast, warm water and 1½ teaspoons sugar. Set aside to allow yeast to become active and foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 3
In a medium saucepan, combine butter with salt and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar and melt over medium-low heat, about 4 minutes. Whisk in sour cream until incorporated. Remove from heat and let cool slightly, 5 to 7 minutes.
Step 4
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine butter mixture, yeast mixture, 1 egg and 1½ cups/195 grams flour. Beat on medium-low speed until smooth. Gradually add remaining 1½ cups/195 grams flour and continue to mix until a dough forms.
Step 5
On a floured work surface, knead the dough by hand, adding more flour if needed, until the dough is elastic and smooth, 5 to 12 minutes. It should be sticky but not sticking to the surface. Butter a large bowl and place dough inside. Cover and let rise in a warm place until it has doubled in size, 1 to 1½ hours.
Step 6
Gently punch down the dough, transfer it to a floured work surface, and roll it out into a 24-by-12-inch rectangle. Be gentle so as to not tear the dough. Spread the apple filling on one long side of the dough to cover half of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border along the edges. Starting with the long side closest to you, fold the border over the filling and tightly roll up the dough in a spiral, enclosing the apple filling as you go. Carefully transfer the roll seam side down to a large parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Moisten ends with water, then bring both ends together to form a ring. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. While the dough rises, heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 7
Brush the egg wash all over the cake. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool for 2 hours before frosting.
Step 8
While cake cools, make the frosting: In a mixing bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the cream cheese, butter, vanilla and orange blossom water. Mix slowly by hand or with a hand or stand mixer until well combined, then gradually add the confectioners’ sugar and mix until incorporated. Continue mixing while slowly adding the milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin out the frosting. The frosting should be thin enough to spread, but not too runny.
Step 9
Carefully flip the cooled cake and cut a small X in the bottom of the ring. Insert the plastic baby and flip the cake back over. Frost the cake and decorate with alternating stripes of gold, green and purple sprinkles.

leftover carcass from a whole roasted chicken, meat picked off and saved for another use
1
large yellow onion

1
tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) or 1½ teaspoons coarse kosher salt
1
tablespoon whole black peppercorns
¼
teaspoon ground turmeric","248 user ratings","1 hour 10 minutes","Step 1
To make this stock in an Instant Pot: Add the chicken carcass to a 3- or 6-quart Instant Pot or other electric pressure cooker. Chop the onion into eighths, and slice the garlic head in half crosswise to expose the cloves; dump the alliums into the pot over the chicken. Crush the bay leaves and add, along with the salt, black peppercorns, and turmeric. Add enough cold water to reach the max line in the 3-quart or to cover the bones in the 6-quart (5 to 6 cups). Gently stir and cover with the lid. Pressure-cook on high for 1 hour and let the pressure release naturally.
Step 2
To make this stock on the stove: Follow Step 1, but place all of the ingredients, including the water, into a large heavy-bottomed pot, such as a Dutch oven or stock pot, and gently stir. Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Cover and cook until the stock is deeply golden, the chicken bones are falling apart at the joints when you try to pick them up and the vegetables have turned to mush, about 3 hours.
Step 3
Strain the contents of the pot through a colander set over a large bowl; press the bones to get out all of the liquid. Taste for seasoning, adjusting with salt as desired. Ladle the stock into large mugs for sipping, or use as an ingredient in your cooking. Alternatively, you can let the strained stock cool slightly before transferring into quart containers and storing in the refrigerator.
Step 4
This chicken stock will keep in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Heat individual portions in coffee mugs to drink in the morning for breakfast, or use as a base for soups, stews and porridges throughout the week.

In a small dish, stir together 1½ tablespoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 tablespoon Morton’s coarse kosher salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 1 teaspoon fennel seeds and the brown sugar.
Step 2
Place the chicken on a large plate or sheet pan and, with a paper towel, pat the surface of the chicken as dry as you can. Remove any giblets from the cavity and reserve for another time. Sprinkle a third of the spice mixture into the cavity of the chicken, focusing especially on the underside of the breasts. Use your hands to really rub the spices into the cavity. Now, sprinkle the rest of the spice mixture all over the surface of the chicken, including the bottom but especially the top, where the breasts are, and again, really rub it into the skin. If roasting right away, let the chicken sit at room temperature for at least 1 hour. Alternatively, you can place the chicken, uncovered, in the refrigerator to dry-brine for up to 24 hours; just be sure to let it sit out at room temperature for at least 1 hour before roasting.

While the chicken is coming to room temperature, position a rack on the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees. On a large sheet pan, add the cabbage, onion, 4 tablespoons olive oil and the remaining 1 teaspoon fennel seeds. Season generously with salt and pepper, and toss until evenly combined. Push the cabbage and onions to the edges of the pan to make room for the chicken, and place the chicken in the center of the pan, breast side up; the chicken should have direct contact with the pan and not be sitting over any of the vegetables. Massage the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil onto the chicken and give it a final generous sprinkling of salt and pepper (going lighter on the seasoning the longer the chicken has been dry-brined).
Step 4
Roast the chicken, rotating the pan halfway through, until the skin is golden brown and crispy, and the thigh meat reaches 160 degrees on an instant-read thermometer (it will continue to cook as it rests), 40 to 55 minutes or 13 minutes per pound. Do not cut into it to check that the juices run clear. The cabbage and onions should be soft and slightly charred in spots.
Step 5
Let the chicken rest for at least 15 minutes on the pan before transferring to a cutting board and carving into portions. Don’t forget to turn the carcass over and eat the two “oysters” on the bottom of the chicken where the back of the thighs meet the spine. It’s arguably the best part of the roast chicken experience, and the chef’s treat.
Step 6
Add the vinegar to the cabbage and onions, toss until evenly distributed and taste for seasoning, adjusting with salt and pepper. Serve alongside the chicken.

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and line a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides.
Step 2
Prepare the brownie layer: In a medium saucepan combine the butter and sugar, and heat over medium until the butter is melted. Remove from the heat and whisk vigorously until well combined.
Step 3
Once the mixture has cooled a bit, whisk in the eggs one at a time. Whisk in the vanilla.
Step 4
Add the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt, and stir to combine. Transfer to a medium bowl.

Make the spice mix: Place all ingredients in a bowl and stir until combined. Set aside 2 tablespoons to add to the gumbo and reserve the rest for another use in an airtight container.
Step 2
Make the gumbo: In a heavy 4- to 5-quart pot, heat the butter and oil over medium heat. Once the butter begins to bubble slightly, add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula to form a smooth paste.
Step 3
Cook the mixture, stirring continuously, for 10 to 13 minutes to make a chocolate-colored roux. Make sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pot to avoid burning. It is important to keep a very close eye on the roux during this step. The roux can go from a nutty color and aroma to burnt beyond repair in a matter of minutes. Lower the heat as needed.
Step 4
Immediately add the onion, garlic, celery, bell pepper and tomatoes and stir well. The vegetables will stop the roux from overcooking and burning. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to stick to the pan, 5 to 10 minutes. Add the dried shrimp, if using, tomato paste and 2 tablespoons spice mix and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.
Step 5
While whisking, slowly add the stock and whisk until the stock is completely blended with the roux and vegetable mixture. Add the okra, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce and let simmer for 50 minutes over very low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Add the lobster, crab, scallops and shrimp and simmer just until cooked through, about 10 minutes more.
Step 6
Season the gumbo to taste with salt and pepper and serve over rice.
To make powdered bay leaf, finely grind dried bay leaves in a spice grinder. If you don’t have a spice grinder, you can omit this from the spice mix and add 4 dried bay leaves to the gumbo when simmering.
Whole dried shrimp can be found in most Asian markets and online. Look for ones that are pink or orange and plump and firm.
If you don’t want to use lobster tail, you can use an additional ½ pound shrimp instead.

Make the shrimp: In a large bowl, toss together the shrimp and 2 teaspoons salt, and set aside. Keep the 8 cups ice nearby, either in another large bowl or directly in the icemaker tray of your refrigerator.
Step 2
Meanwhile, fill a large pot with 8 cups water, ½ cup salt, the chile powder and celery seeds, and bring to a boil. Remove the pot from the heat and add the shrimp to the hot liquid, stirring occasionally, until just cooked through and no longer translucent on the inside, 2 to 3 minutes.

Immediately dump the ice into the pot to stop the cooking, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is cool to warm or room temperature, about 1 minute.

1½
cups coarsely ground cornmeal
1
teaspoon baking powder
1
teaspoon granulated sugar
¾
teaspoon fine salt
2
tablespoons unsalted butter","110 user ratings","4 hours","Step 1
Make the stock: In a large heavy stockpot, bring 3 quarts water, the smoked meat, onions, celery, carrots, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaves to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and simmer, partially covered, until the flavors are well blended, about 2 hours.
Step 2
Remove the meat from the broth. When cool enough to handle, pull the meat off the bones (discard the skin, fat, and bones). Chop the meat and reserve for another use. (The meat can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 week.) Use a fine-mesh sieve to strain the stock into a container. Refrigerate the stock until the fat floats to the top or skim the fat using a fat separator or spoon to use immediately. For chilled stock, use a slotted spoon to skim off the fat and discard. Pour out 6 cups stock to use; reserve the rest for another use in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
Step 3
Make the collards: In a medium saucepan, bring the 6 cups stock, the onion and garlic to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, cover and simmer while preparing the greens.
Step 4
Thoroughly wash the collards and trim away the stems, if desired. Discard the stems or coarsely chop. Stack 2 or 3 leaves on a cutting board and roll tightly into a log. Slice the greens crosswise into ¼-inch-wide ribbons. Place the greens and stems, if using, and the chiles in the broth and return to a simmer. Cook, covered, about 1½ hours for very tender greens; you may cook them for less time if you have young greens or prefer greens with more chew. Season to taste with salt and black pepper.
Step 5
About half an hour before the collards are done, prepare the dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar and salt. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Spoon out ½ cup of the potlikker from the collards and add to the butter. Remove from the heat and stir it into the dry ingredients, adding more potlikker 1 tablespoon at a time if needed for the dough to come together into a mass. Let stand 5 minutes. When cool enough to handle, use wet fingertips to shape the dough into 6 round dumplings.
Step 6
During the last 15 minutes of the collards’ cooking time, carefully drop the cornmeal dumplings into the pot with the greens, making sure the dumplings are submerged in the potlikker. Cover the pot and simmer until the dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve the greens and dumplings in bowls with plenty of potlikker.

Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Season all over with 1½ teaspoons salt and the black pepper. Finely grate, pass through a press or mince 2 garlic cloves. Set aside half the grated garlic for finishing the dish. Rub the rest all over the chicken pieces. Set aside the chicken while preparing the other ingredients.
Step 2
In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, combine 1 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter. When the butter melts, add chicken in batches and cook until browned on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes per side. If the pan dries out, add a little more oil as needed. Transfer browned chicken to a plate.
Step 3
Add remaining tablespoon each oil and butter to the pan. Once the butter melts, add mushrooms and cook undisturbed until well browned on one side, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir and cook for 1 minute longer.
Step 4
Thinly slice 2 garlic cloves. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in sliced garlic, leeks and a large pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are tender and golden brown, 7 minutes. Add rosemary and wine to the pot and let simmer, scraping up the browned bits, until liquid reduces by half, about 1 minute.
Step 5
Nestle chicken, skin side up, into the pan and pour in any accumulated juices from the plate. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, covered, until chicken is cooked through, 25 to 35 minutes.
Step 6
Transfer chicken to a serving platter and tent with foil to keep warm. Pluck the rosemary sprigs from the pot. If the sauce looks thin, turn the heat to medium-high and let simmer until it thickens slightly, 2 to 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining grated garlic, the crème fraîche, chives and lemon zest. Taste sauce and add more salt if needed. Spoon sauce over the chicken and top with parsley, more lemon zest and a dollop of crème fraîche, if you like, and serve.

2
large egg yolks
¼
cup/58 milliliters cold water
For the Filling
½
cup/144 grams honey, such as wildflower
6
tablespoons/75 grams unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes
⅓
cup/63 grams granulated sugar
4
small rosemary sprigs
1
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1
large egg plus 2 large egg yolks
½
cup heavy cream
1¼
cups/156 grams sliced almonds","529 user ratings","2 hours, plus 1 hour’s chilling","Step 1
Prepare the crust: Generously butter a 10-inch round (¾- to 1-inch deep) fluted tart pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, lemon zest and salt. Working quickly, rub or cut the cold butter into the dry mixture using your fingers or a pastry cutter until the pieces are the size of small pebbles. (Alternatively, use a food processor to pulse the dry ingredients with the butter.) Add the egg yolks and the cold water. Using your hands, combine just until the dough comes together in clumps. Gather dough into a ball; flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 week (see Tip).
Step 2
While the dough chills, prepare the filling: In a small pot set over medium-low, combine the honey, rosemary sprigs, sugar, butter and salt. Stir frequently until the butter melts and the sugar dissolves, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool for at least 10 minutes. Whisk the egg, yolks and cream in a liquid measuring cup. Remove the rosemary sprigs from the honey and whisk the egg mixture into the honey mixture until fully blended. Stir in the almonds. The filling can be covered and refrigerated for up to a week (see Tip).
Step 3
Using a floured rolling pin, roll out chilled dough between two sheets of parchment paper or on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch round. To transfer to the tart pan, roll the dough around the rolling pin, then unroll it over the pan without stretching it. Gently press the dough into the fluted sides and, using a pair of kitchen scissors or a sharp knife, trim any overhang to ¼ inch above the pan. Refrigerate the tart shell until firm, at least 20 minutes. Heat oven to 375 degrees while the dough chills.
Step 4
Line the tart dough with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the crust is lightly browned along the edges and beginning to firm up, about 18 minutes. Remove the pie weights and parchment and bake for another 5 minutes to lightly brown the edges. Press down the bottom surface with the back of a spoon if the crust bubbles. Allow the crust to cool completely before filling. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
Step 5
Place the tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet and carefully pour the filling into the cooled tart shell. Bake until the filling is set, deep golden brown and jiggles slowly when the pan is moved back and forth, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool the tart completely before slicing. The tart will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days, or can be cooled, wrapped and frozen for up to 1 month. Defrost before serving.
The tart dough and the filling can be made ahead and refrigerated separately for up to 1 week. Stir the filling before pouring into the tart shell to evenly distribute the ingredients.

large eggs
1
teaspoon distilled white vinegar

Butter and toast, for serving

Ham and cheese, for serving (optional)

Salt and pepper, for serving","539 user ratings","10 minutes","Step 1
Fill a large skillet, ideally one with straight, tall sides, with water to a depth of 1½ inches. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Using a slotted spoon, carefully place the whole, uncracked eggs in the water and roll them around for 15 to 20 seconds, so they’re evenly warm. Take them out of the skillet. Add the vinegar to the boiling water.
Step 2
Crack the eggs into the boiling water one at a time, spacing them apart (if they're too hot to the touch, wait a few seconds until they feel OK to handle). Adjust the heat to keep the water steadily and lightly boiling. Let the eggs poach until the whites are opaque and firm, and the yolks are set to your desired doneness, 3 to 6 minutes. Gently nudge the yolk with the spoon to check for doneness: Very runny yolks will wobble like a water balloon; standard runny yolks will feel soft but set; firm yolks will feel solid.
Step 3
Transfer to paper towels with the slotted spoon and gently pat dry. Butter toast and layer with ham and cheese, if using. Place poached eggs on top, season with salt and pepper, and top with another pat of butter, if you like.

3¼
teaspoons/13 grams baking powder
½
teaspoon fine sea salt

Vegetable oil, such as grape seed or canola, for the muffin tin","254 user ratings","1 hour 20 minutes","Step 1
Drain the chickpeas, reserving ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon/140 grams aquafaba (chickpea liquid). (Reserve the chickpeas and any remaining liquid for another use.)
Step 2
In a large pitcher or bowl, whisk the aquafaba, vinegar and 1½ cups/350 milliliters water together. Sift the all-purpose flour, chickpea flour and baking powder into a medium bowl. Add the salt and whisk together.
Step 3
Pour the combined liquids into the dry ingredients and whisk together until smooth and bubbly, about 30 seconds. Pour back into the pitcher and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
Step 4
While the batter chills, heat oven to 425 degrees.
Step 5
Using a standard 12-cup metal muffin tin (with ½-cup cavities), preferably nonstick, add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil to each of 9 cups. About 10 minutes before the batter is done chilling, place the oiled tin in the hot oven to heat.
Step 6
Carefully remove the muffin tin from the oven. Stir the batter and pour into the muffin cups; the batter should sizzle vigorously as you add it, and each cup should be nearly full. Return to the oven.
Step 7
Bake for 30 minutes. The puddings will rise, then fall, possibly making a well on the top. Turn down the heat to 400 degrees and bake about 10 minutes more, or until the tops are deep golden brown and the insides are cooked through and just dry (peer into the well to check; the inside should be matte, not shiny). Remove from the oven, let the puddings rest for about 3 minutes, then use a spoon or spatula to lift from the tin and serve immediately.

1
cup/102 grams confectioners’ sugar, sifted if lumpy
1
teaspoon whole milk or heavy cream
½
teaspoon vanilla extract","2904 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly grease a 9-inch round cake pan.
Step 2
Make the filling: In a medium bowl, using a flexible spatula or wooden spoon, mix butter, brown sugar and cinnamon until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the pecans. Set aside.
Step 3
Make the rolls: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda. Add the oil and, using a flexible spatula or wooden spoon, mix until incorporated. (It might be a little lumpy. That’s OK!) Stir in the buttermilk until just blended. Gather the dough into a ball and knead on a lightly floured surface until smooth, about 1 minute. Roll out the dough into a 15-by-8-inch rectangle.
Step 4
Gently spread the filling evenly over the dough, leaving a ¼-inch border all around. Starting from one of the long sides, roll up the dough into a tight cylinder. Rotate the roll so that the seam is against the work surface. Using a serrated knife, cut the roll crosswise into eight equal slices. Transfer the rolls to the prepared pan, spacing them evenly. (At this point, you can wrap with plastic wrap and refrigerate for a day or 2, or freeze for up to 3 months. Allow to come to room temperature before proceeding.)
Step 5
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden.
Step 6
While the rolls bake, make the glaze: In a medium bowl, using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, beat the cream cheese until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar and beat well. Add the milk and vanilla, and beat until smooth and creamy. Set aside.
Step 7
Remove the rolls from the oven and allow to cool for 3 to 4 minutes before coating with the glaze. Serve warm.
To toast the pecans, place on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven for 6 to 8 minutes, or until lightly browned and fragrant.

cup chopped fresh, soft herbs, such as parsley, mint, dill, basil, tarragon, chives or a combination

Fresh lemon juice, to taste","7933 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Heat a large pot over medium-high for a minute or so to warm it up. Add the oil and heat until it thins out, about 30 seconds. Add onion and carrot, and sauté until very soft and brown at the edges, 7 to 10 minutes.
Step 2
Meanwhile, rinse the greens and pull the leaves off the stems. Tear or chop into bite-size pieces and set aside.
Step 3
When the onion is golden, add tomato paste, ¾ teaspoon cumin and ⅛ teaspoon red-pepper flakes to the pot, and sauté until paste darkens, about 1 minute. Add turkey, garlic, ginger and 1 teaspoon salt, and sauté, breaking up the meat with your spoon, until turkey is browned in spots, 4 to 7 minutes.
Step 4
Add stock and beans, and bring to a simmer. Let simmer until the soup is thick and flavorful, adding more salt if needed, 15 to 25 minutes. If you like a thicker broth, you can smash some of the beans with the back of the spoon to release their starch. Or leave the beans whole for a brothier soup.
Step 5
Add the greens to the pot and simmer until they are very soft. This will take 5 to 10 minutes for most greens, but tough collard greens might take 15 minutes. (Add a little water if the broth gets too reduced.)
Step 6
Stir herbs and lemon juice into the pot, taste and add more salt, cumin and lemon until the broth is lively and bright-tasting. Serve topped with a drizzle of olive oil and more red-pepper flakes, if desired.

Spread the mushrooms and thyme sprigs in an even layer on a sheet pan and drizzle with ¼ cup oil. Season with salt and, using your hands, toss to coat. Roast, turning the pan halfway through and tossing the mushrooms, until mushrooms are golden brown and crisp along the edges, about 25 to 35 minutes.

cup plus 1 tablespoon/95 grams mascarpone
2
tablespoons malted milk powder, such as Horlick’s
¼
cup plus 2 teaspoons/30 grams confectioners’ sugar (icing sugar)

Tiny pinch of salt","608 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius (nonfan)/375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line the bottom of 2 (20-centimeter/8-inch) cake pans (tins) with a removable base with parchment paper and grease the sides. Alternatively, grease the bottoms and sides of 2 (20-centimeter/8-inch) regular cake pans, line with parchment, and grease the parchment.
Step 2
In a large bowl, whisk together cocoa, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugars. In a separate bowl, add the oil, eggs and kefir, and whisk just to combine. Add to the dry mixture and use a spatula to gently fold through. Add the ¾ cup plus 3 tablespoons/220 grams hot coffee and mix gently to combine. It’ll look very runny at first, but will soon come together into a glossy, pourable batter.
Step 3
Divide the batter evenly between the two cake pans, about 21 ounces/600 grams per pan. Bake for 30 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Set aside to cool for about 30 minutes, then slide a butter knife along the sides to help release the cake. Brush the tops lightly with the remaining 1 tablespoon/14 grams extra coffee (discard any extra).
Step 4
Invert one cake onto a board, remove the parchment, then invert it again onto a cake stand or the platter you intend to serve it on (domed side up now). Invert the other cake onto a board (don’t remove the paper). Invert it again, onto a plate, so that it’s paper side down. (This will help prevent it from sticking.) Set both cakes aside to cool completely.
Step 5
Make the praline: With the oven still at 200 degrees Celsius/375 degrees Fahrenheit, spread the hazelnuts onto a parchment-lined medium baking sheet (tray) and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until deeply golden, shaking the pan halfway through baking. Set aside, keeping the tray and parchment paper. You’ll use them again later.
Step 6
Place a large saucepan over a medium-high heat and, once quite hot, sprinkle in a third of the caster sugar to cover the base. It should immediately start to melt at the sides but not brown too quickly. Swirl the sugar in the pan a little, then add another third of the sugar, allowing it to melt a little before adding the remaining third. Turn the heat down to medium and cook until the sugar is an amber caramel, stirring with a spatula just a couple times (but not much more). Add the hazelnuts and ¼ teaspoon salt, stirring to coat, then quickly transfer the mixture to your parchment-lined tray and leave to cool completely.
Step 7
Once cool, roughly break apart the praline and add it to a food processor. Pulse a few times until you have very coarse crumbs, then measure out about ½ cup/75 grams of the mixture and transfer to a bowl. Blitz the remaining mixture in the food processor for about 5 minutes or until it turns into the consistency of a smooth nut butter, stopping to scrape the inside of the bowl as necessary. Transfer this to a separate bowl.
Step 8
Make the mascarpone cream: Add all the ingredients to a stand mixer and beat on medium-high speed for 1½ to 2 minutes, or until you have medium peaks. Refrigerate if not assembling right away (you want it nice and cold).
Step 9
When ready to assemble, top the cake on your cake stand with half the cream mixture. Spoon over about 2 tablespoons of the smooth praline and gently swirl it through the cream with your spatula. Top with another 2 tablespoons of the praline, this time without swirling. Sprinkle with half the praline crumble. Carefully invert the other cake on top now, removing the paper. Top with the remaining cream and repeat the same process with the smooth praline and praline crumble. Serve right away, or refrigerate overnight to firm up the cream before serving. (The cake will keep refrigerated for up to 3 days.)

(15-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk
½
cup heavy cream
4
teaspoons rum extract, plus more to taste
2
tablespoons granulated sugar
¾
teaspoon ground cinnamon

Pinch of salt
4
large egg yolks","84 user ratings","45 minutes, plus overnight chilling","Step 1
Prepare your ice cream machine, freezing the insert bowl if needed.
Step 2
In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the cream of coconut, coconut milk, heavy cream, rum extract, sugar, cinnamon and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cream of coconut melts down and all the ingredients are incorporated, making sure it does not come to a boil, about 5 minutes.
Step 3
As the coconut mixture cooks, place the egg yolks in a small bowl, add ¼ cup of the coconut mixture to the yolks and whisk quickly and vigorously. (This will temper, or bring up the temperature, of the eggs, so they don’t set.) Pour the yolk mixture into the saucepan with the remaining coconut mixture, and immediately start whisking over medium heat. Continue whisking until it thickens and tastes intense, about 2 minutes. If you dip a spoon in the custard, it should coat the back. Run your finger through that coating; the stripe should hold for 3 seconds. Stir in more rum extract if you’d like.
Step 4
Set a fine-mesh strainer over a food storage container or a bowl with a lid that can hold at least 1 quart. Strain the ice cream base into the container, to catch any pieces of egg that may have solidified, cover and refrigerate overnight.
Step 5
Set up your ice cream maker, add the ice cream base to its bowl and churn according to manufacturers’ instructions. It should increase in volume and look thick and creamy, the consistency of soft ice cream. Serve the ice cream right out of the machine, or for a better, more traditional texture (think store-bought ice cream), transfer the churned ice cream to a food storage container and freeze for 4 to 5 more hours.

"Moin Moin (Steamed Bean Cakes)","African,Beans,Project,Banana Leaf,Honey Bean,Red Pepper,Main Course,Vegan","Yield: About 12 moin moin","2
cups whole dried honey beans or store-bought peeled black-eyed peas (see Tip)
1
pound frozen banana leaves, defrosted, for steaming
2
roasted red bell peppers from a jar, drained, stemmed and seeded
1
small red onion, peeled and quartered
1
red scotch bonnet or habanero chile, stemmed
1
tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
½
teaspoon garlic powder
½
teaspoon onion powder
½
cup grapeseed oil
1
cup roasted mushrooms with ata din din, for filling (optional)","38 user ratings","1½ hours, plus soaking","Step 1
Place the beans in a medium bowl and cover with up to 2 inches of room temperature water. Soak the beans for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until plump and the peel comes right off when you rub a bean between your palms.
Step 2
Meanwhile, cut the banana leaves into 11- to 13-inch squares (depending on the width of your leaves). Save any trimmings to line the pot. Wipe the leaves clean with a damp towel. Place a stockpot or 10-inch Dutch oven on the stove and line the entire bottom with up to two layers of banana leaf trimmings. (It’s OK if some of the leaves come up the sides slightly.) Pour 2 cups water in the bottom of the pot, underneath the leaf layer.
Step 3
Peel all the beans: Skip this step if you are using peeled black-eyed peas, but discard the soaking liquid. Fill the bowl with more water, grab a handful of beans and, working in the water, rub the beans between your palms. The peels will come right off and float above the beans. (The extra water will help provide an area for the skins to collect away from the beans.) Holding back the beans with one hand, pour the water and the peels into a colander set inside the kitchen sink. Discard the peels. Again fill the bowl with water to cover by several inches, peel and drain. Repeat this step up to 4 more times until about 95 percent of the beans are peeled.
Step 4
Working in batches if necessary and using some of all the ingredients in each batch, transfer the peeled beans, roasted red peppers, onion and scotch bonnet to a blender and purée with 1¾ cups water until smooth. The purée should be the consistency similar to a loose, whipped hummus. Transfer to a bowl and add the salt, garlic powder and onion powder. Mix in the oil.
Step 5
To shape the banana leaves for filling, working one square at a time, make a cone by lifting the bottom left corner towards the center, creating a straight vertical line that should line up with the center of the leaf. With your finger holding the center in place, hold up the leaf and use your other hand to fold the bottom right corner of the leaf over the left fold. You should now have a cone shape with a closed, pointy bottom and an open top. Tighten the cone by pulling the right edge over until the bottom is closed. Fold about 1½ inches of the pointy bottom back and upward, sealing the bottom of the cone completely. Line any tears on the inside of the cone with little pieces of leaf trimming. Hold the cone in an upright position with your finger on the folded bottom to keep the bottom edge sealed.
Step 6
Fill the cone by scooping in ½ cup of the bean purée. Add a heaped tablespoon of the roasted mushroom mix on top, if using. Place the filled cone upright in the prepared stockpot, sealed side down, leaving the tops open and leaning the cones up against the edge of the pot and one another to keep them sealed. Repeat this folding and filling step until all the purée is used up and the filled cones are all upright in the pot. If there is too much room in the pot, use the scrap pieces of banana leaves to fill the extra space and to keep the cones upright and sealed. Cover the top of the pot with several leaves (no need to trim them if there’s overhang) to keep the steam within the pot and place the lid on top.
Step 7
Set the heat to medium and steam the moin moin until firm, about 25 to 30 minutes. You can test for doneness by taking one out, unwrapping and cutting through the middle. There should be no loose, raw batter, and the moin moin should be set firm. Allow the moin moin to sit in the covered pot for 15 minutes off heat to set up a bit more and to cool slightly. Transfer the wrapped cones to a baking sheet or serving platter. Unwrap and serve warm, by itself or alongside jollof rice, efo riro and dodo.
Honey beans, also known as ewa oloyin in Yoruba, can be found at any West African market. To get the peels off honey beans, soak in room temperature water for at least 45 minutes and no longer than 1 hour and follow the directions given in Step 3. For convenience, peeled beans (usually black-eyed peas) are also available in West African markets. If using peeled black-eyed peas, soak the beans in room temperature water to rehydrate for 1 hour and up to 4 hours.

"Cuban Buñuelos With Anise Syrup","Cuban,Anise,Boniato,Calabaza,Malanga,Name,Yuca,Dessert,Winter,Christmas","Yield: 14 buñuelos","For the Syrup
1
cup granulated sugar
1
whole star anise
1
cinnamon stick
1
(3-inch) strip lime peel
1
tablespoon lime juice
For the Buñuelos
½
pound peeled yuca, cut into 1-inch pieces, or precut frozen yuca (see Tip)
¼
pound peeled boniato, cut into 1-inch pieces
¼
pound peeled malanga, cut into 1-inch pieces
¼
pound peeled ñame, cut into 1-inch pieces
1
tablespoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1
teaspoon whole anise seeds
¼
pound peeled calabaza (or other winter squash or pumpkin), cut into 2-inch pieces
3 to 4
cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
3
large eggs, beaten
2
cups canola oil","28 user ratings","2 hours 30 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the syrup: In a saucepan, combine 2 cups water, granulated sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick and lime peel, and bring to a boil over medium high, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce heat to a simmer, then cook until the mixture is thin and syrupy, 15 to 20 minutes. Off the heat, add the fresh lime juice. Let the syrup cool while you make buñuelos.
Step 2
Make the buñuelos: To a medium or large heavy pot, add the yuca, boniato, malanga, ñame, salt and anise seeds and enough cold water to cover. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Add the calabaza and cook, covered, until all the vegetables are tender, but not mushy, 10 to 15 minutes more, then drain in a colander.
Step 3
While the vegetables are still warm, press the vegetables through a ricer or food mill onto a large lightly floured surface or bowl. Form the mixture into a big mound, then make a well in the center. Pour the eggs into the well and use your hands (it will be sticky) to fully combine. Sift 3 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, over the dough and knead after each addition until it forms a smooth, soft dough that holds together. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons more flour if needed for the dough to come together.
Step 4
Cut the dough into 14 equal pieces, and transfer to a clean work surface. Roll each piece into a 16-inch rope about ½-inch-thick. Moisten one end of the rope with a little water, shape it into a figure eight, then press the ends together. Transfer to a sheet pan lightly dusted with flour.
Step 5
In a 10-inch skillet, heat the canola oil over medium-high until it reaches 375 degrees. If you don’t have a deep-fry thermometer, you can test the oil by dropping in a bit of dough. If the oil is hot enough, it will float to the top right away. Working in batches of 2 or 3 (don’t crowd the pan), carefully add the buñuelos to the oil, and fry until they are golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Spoon the syrup over the buñuelos and serve.
If using fresh yuca root, chop off each end and cut it into manageable pieces. (Yuca is very hard, so be careful.) Use a knife or a vegetable peeler to remove the outer bark and the white, waxy layer beneath. Remove the woody core in the center before boiling. If using frozen yuca, remove the woody stem after the vegetables are drained in Step 2.

"Raisin Cinnamon Roll Wreath","Cream Cheese,Ground Cinnamon,Raisin,Breakfast,Brunch,Main Course,Christmas,New Year’s Day","Yield: About 2 dozen rolls","For the Dough
4
cups/540 grams bread flour or all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
¼
cup/50 grams granulated sugar
4½

For the Icing
4
ounces/115 grams cream cheese, softened
2
tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
½
cup/60 grams confectioners’ sugar
1
teaspoon pure vanilla extract
3
tablespoons whole milk, plus more as needed","225 user ratings","4 hours","Step 1
Prepare the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt. Toss with your hands to mix.
Step 2
In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once it’s melted, add the milk and remove from the heat. The mixture should register 125 to 130 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, so let it cool or warm it as needed. It should feel warm to the touch, but not be hot. Pour the warmed milk mixture into the flour mixture, along with the beaten eggs. Turn the mixer to medium-low speed, and knead until the flour has been fully incorporated and you're left with a smooth, supple dough that's firm to the touch, about 5 minutes. (When you press it with your thumb, the dough should spring back gradually.)
Step 3
Gather the dough and shape it into a round ball in your hands, then transfer to a large, lightly buttered bowl, turning over a couple times to coat with the butter. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Step 4
While the dough is rising, prepare the filling: Place the raisins in a large heatproof bowl and cover with boiling water. Allow to sit for 10 minutes to plump, then drain, and return to the bowl. Add the almond extract and toss with a spoon to coat. Set aside to cool, about 20 minutes.
Step 5
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt mixing with a fork or your hands to remove any clumps. Set aside.
Step 6
Fill and assemble the dough: Lightly flour a clean working surface, and a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper nearby. Cut the risen dough in half with a pair of kitchen shears. Place one half of the dough on the floured surface, keeping the other half covered in the bowl. Lightly flour a rolling pin and roll the dough out to a 12-by-9-inch rectangle (about ¼ inch thick), picking up the dough to stretch and turn it with your hands to make the edges as straight and even as possible. Spread 4 tablespoons of butter evenly over the entire surface using the back of a spoon. Evenly sprinkle over half the almond mixture, spreading with your hands to cover every inch. Firmly pat the mixture down to help it adhere to the butter. Evenly sprinkle over half of the raisins, pressing down firmly to help keep them in place.
Step 7
Starting with one of the longer edges, tightly roll the dough into a log ending with the seam side down on the counter pressing the log down firmly to help seal the seam closed. The log will feel very stuffed. Wipe down and re-flour the work surface, then repeat with the other half of the dough and the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, almond mixture and raisins.
Step 8
Carefully transfer the two rolled logs, seam side down, to the lined sheet pan and arrange together to form an oval or circle with their ends barely touching. Using kitchen shears with the point of the shears facing down toward the counter, cut slits into the ring roughly 1 inch apart, being careful not to cut all the way through the ring by leaving a ½ inch dough still attached at the bottom. One by one, lean every other rolled piece outward away from the center of the ring, creating a staggered look. Make any final adjustments to the shape that you like, turning some rolls up slightly to create air between them and filling out the baking sheet, being sure to keep a rough circular or oval shape.
Step 9
Loosely cover the entire pan with plastic wrap and allow it to rest on the counter until slightly puffed, 30 to 40 minutes. (At this point, you can refrigerate the dough overnight: Wrap the entire pan of slightly proofed rolls very well in plastic wrap, being sure not to squish the rolls, but ensuring the wrapping is airtight. Chill for up to 12 hours. Remove the pan from the fridge and place them on the counter for an hour or so before you’re ready to bake them, so they come to room temperature.)
Step 10
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, stir the milk and the granulated sugar with a spoon until the sugar dissolves. Uncover the risen rolls. Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of the rolls with the milk wash.
Step 11
Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until the wreath is deeply golden brown on top and the edges of the rolls are puffed and cooked through. Remove the rolls from the oven and place the sheet pan on a cooling rack, and allow to cool for 30 minutes.
Step 12
When the rolls are almost done cooling, make the icing: In a medium bowl, using a fork, mix the cream cheese and butter. Add the confectioners’ sugar and mix until smooth and most of the clumps of sugar are gone. Add the vanilla and milk and mix. The icing should be thin enough to drizzle. If it isn’t, mix in another tablespoon of milk.
Step 13
With your serving platter nearby, carefully lift the wreath using the parchment and lower onto the platter with the paper. Tear the parchment down the center and along the edges, then carefully pull out the paper without disturbing the wreath. Decorate the finished wreath with the icing: Drizzle it over the top with a fork or transfer to a piping bag with a small tip or a resealable plastic bag with a corner cut open to pipe thin lines along the tops of the rolls. Or smear the icing all over the tops of the rolls using a butter knife. Decorate with a ribbon, or dried or sugared fruit. Serve warm.

1
large egg
1
tablespoon/15 grams unsalted butter, melted and cooled
1
teaspoon vanilla extract

Up to ¾ cup/180 milliliters warm water, as needed
2
cups/475 milliliters vegetable oil","108 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
Make the piloncillo syrup: In a medium saucepan, heat 1 cup/240 milliliters water and the piloncillo over medium-high until the piloncillo dissolves, the liquid has thickened slightly and is caramel-colored, about 5 minutes. Carefully add 2½ cups/600 milliliters water to the pan, along with the cinnamon stick, guavas (if using), anise seeds and orange peel. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high, then reduce the heat to low and simmer until syrupy, about 30 minutes. If you’d like it thicker, cook for a bit longer. Strain the syrup into a small bowl and set it aside. (You should have about 1¼ cups/60 milliliters.)
Step 2
Make the buñuelos: In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Form a well in the center and add the egg, melted butter and vanilla extract. Using a wooden spoon or your hands, stir the ingredients together until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Slowly add the warm water, 1 tablespoon/15 milliliters at a time, constantly mixing then kneading, until the dough is soft and smooth. (You may not need all of the water.) Cover the dough with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for 30 minutes. On a lightly floured surface, divide the dough into 12 small balls and cover with the kitchen towel. (At this point, you can wrap the balls tightly with plastic wrap and freeze for up to two months. Bring to room temperature before rolling out and frying.)
Step 3
In a large, high-sided skillet, pour the vegetable oil until it’s about ¾-inch high and heat over medium high to 350 degrees. When the oil is ready, a small piece of dough should sizzle immediately when dropped in.
Step 4
While the oil is heating, roll out the dough: Work with one ball at a time, and leave the others covered while you work. On a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out the dough into a paper-thin 8-inch circle. (It should be almost transparent but not tear.) As you roll, move and flip the dough and add more flour as necessary so it doesn’t stick. Set aside on a lightly floured surface. Repeat with the remaining balls.
Step 5
Fry the buñuelos, one at a time, until golden brown and crispy, 20 to 40 seconds per side. Use tongs to gently flatten the dough as it cooks to help prevent it from curling. Place the fried buñuelos on a paper towel-lined plate. Immediately sprinkle the buñuelos with granulated sugar, drizzle the syrup and serve. (Store leftovers in an airtight plastic container at room temperature for up to three days. Recrisp in a 300-degree oven for 5 minutes and sprinkle with granulated sugar.)
Piloncillo cones can be ordered online or can be found at Latino grocery stores.

"​​Crisp Roast Duck","Poultry,Plan Ahead,Whole Duck,Dinner,Main Course,Christmas,New Year’s Day","Yield: 4 servings","1
(5- to 6-pound) whole duck
1
tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
2
teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
2

1
tablespoon chopped thyme or rosemary leaves, or a combination, plus more sprigs for the cavity
1
tablespoon finely grated lemon or orange zest, or a combination
1½
teaspoons ground coriander or a spice mix, such as  garam masala  or baharat(optional)","743 user ratings","2½ hours, plus at least 4 hours’ resting","Step 1
Bring a full kettle or medium pot of water to a boil (at least 2 quarts).
Step 2
Meanwhile, remove giblets and neck from the duck cavity and reserve for another use. Trim any excess fat from around the duck cavity and the neck. Place duck, breast side up, on a rack in the sink. Pour half of the boiling water all over the top of the duck to tighten the skin. Flip the bird and pour remaining boiling water over the back.
Step 3
Once the duck is cool enough to handle, using the tip of a very sharp paring knife, prick duck skin all over to help release the fat, especially where the skin is thickest, and be careful not to pierce the meat. It can be helpful to hold the knife nearly parallel to the bird. After piercing the skin, use the knife blade to score the duck breast in a crosshatch pattern (making deep cuts into the skin only, and not into the breast meat). Flip the bird and score the back as well (you don’t need to prick the back). You may need to sharpen your knife along the way, as it’s much easier to make clean cuts into the skin with a sharp knife. Using a clean kitchen towel or paper towels, thoroughly pat duck dry, including inside the cavity.
Step 4
Season the duck all over, including cavity, with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, combine garlic, chopped herbs, citrus zest and coriander, if using, and make a paste. Rub garlic paste all over duck, inside and out. Place duck, breast side up, on rack in a roasting pan, stuff cavity with herb sprigs, and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
Step 5
When it’s time to cook the bird, heat the oven to 450 degrees. Roast for 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and carefully prick duck skin all over the top of the bird using a sharp paring knife. (You don’t need to prick the back of the duck.) Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and continue roasting until skin is golden brown and crispy, and the internal temperature at thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour to 1 hour 45 minutes longer. Using tongs, gently tip duck to drain any liquid from the cavity. Transfer bird to cutting board to rest for at least 10 minutes. Carve and serve.

teaspoons potato starch, tapioca starch or cornstarch
4
tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into ¼-inch cubes
4
eggs (see Tip)

Pinch of kosher salt","6334 user ratings","5 minutes","Step 1
In a medium bowl, whisk together starch with 1½ tablespoons water until no lumps remain. Add half the butter cubes to starch mixture. Add eggs and salt, and whisk, breaking up any cubes of butter that have stuck together, until the eggs are frothy and homogenous. (There will still be solid chunks of butter in the eggs.)
Step 2
Set your serving plate near the stovetop. Heat 1 tablespoon water in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high, swirling gently until the water evaporates, leaving behind only a few small droplets. Immediately add the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and swirl vigorously until the butter is mostly melted and foamy but not brown, about 10 seconds.
Step 3
Immediately add the egg mixture and cook, pushing and folding the eggs with a spatula, until they are slightly less cooked than you’d like them, about 1 to 2 minutes, depending on doneness. More vigorous stirring will result in finer, softer curds, while more leisurely stirring will result in larger, fluffier curds. Immediately transfer to the serving plate, and serve.
If cooking fewer eggs or more, adjust pan size accordingly, and note that cooking time in Step 3 can vary significantly, needing as little as 15 to 30 seconds for 2 eggs, or as long as 3 to 4 minutes for 8 eggs.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the udon noodles and cook for about 2 minutes, using wooden chopsticks or tongs to gently loosen the noodles from their tight bundle. Drain, rinse with cold water and leave to continue draining while you prepare the remaining ingredients.
Step 2
Heat a wok or large (12-inch) skillet on medium-high, until very hot. Add oil and mushrooms, and stir-fry for 7 to 8 minutes, leaving undisturbed for 30 seconds to 1 minute at a time, to allow them to caramelize. (Be patient: They will release a lot of liquid, then start to brown.) Add the garlic, ½ teaspoon salt and a few turns of black pepper. Drizzle the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of honey, then add 3 tablespoons of butter and toss.
Step 3
Add the udon noodles, Napa cabbage and soy sauce to the pan, then toss for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted and everything is well combined. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon honey and 1 tablespoon butter. Taste and season with more salt and black pepper, if required.

In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the potatoes, cauliflower, beans, onion, garlic, vegetable stock, butter, wine, thyme, garlic powder and 1½ teaspoons kosher salt. Cover and cook until the vegetables are very tender, about 8 hours on low.
Step 2
Remove and discard the thyme sprig, and turn off the slow cooker. Add the lemon juice. To make a completely smooth and creamy soup, purée the ingredients using an immersion blender. (Or, purée the soup in a blender in two batches, transferring the puréed soup to a different pot.) To make a textured, chunky soup, smash the ingredients using a potato masher in the slow cooker. Stir in the sour cream and chives. Taste and add additional salt if necessary. Serve in bowls topped with black pepper, crushed potato chips and shredded Cheddar. For leftovers, gently reheat the soup on the stovetop or in the microwave until it just barely bubbles around the edges; don’t let it boil or the sour cream will break.

"Coconut-Lemongrass Tapioca With Caramelized Citrus","African,Caramel,Citrus,Coconut Milk,Tapioca Pearl,Dessert,Vegan,Vegetarian","Yield: 6 to 8 servings","½
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
1
cup/190 grams small pearl tapioca
2
(13½-ounce) cans full-fat coconut milk
1
stalk lemongrass (about 2¼ ounces), tough outer part discarded, roughly chopped and smashed

3½
pounds/1½ kilograms mixed citrus fruits, such as oranges, blood oranges, tangerines and pink grapefruit
¾
cup/138 grams granulated sugar
¼
cup crushed pistachios (optional)","227 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
In a small pot, bring 3 cups of water to a boil and add ¼ teaspoon of salt. Add the tapioca pearls and simmer gently over medium-low heat, stirring frequently until the tapioca is softened and almost all the way translucent, 12 minutes.
Step 2
Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and allow the tapioca to steam and cook through completely, 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, cover it and refrigerate until ready to serve. You can prepare the tapioca up to 3 days in advance and store it in the refrigerator.
Step 3
Wash out the pot and pour in the coconut milk. Add the lemongrass, the ginger and 1 tablespoon maple syrup. Bring up to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and zest the lime into the milk. Allow the infused milk to steep while you prepare the fruit and the caramel.
Step 4
Remove the tops and bottoms of the citrus by cutting the ends with a sharp knife so each fruit sits flat on your work surface. Cut the citrus peels off into strips, running your knife down the length of the fruit and carefully removing the white pith as you slice. Cut each fruit crosswise into ½-inch-thick rounds and remove any visible seeds.
Step 5
Make a caramel: Heat a large (12-inch) skillet over medium. Add the sugar and cook, stirring frequently, until the sugar melts and forms a light golden syrup, 5 to 7 minutes. Cook the syrup until deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more, lowering the heat slightly if necessary to avoid scorching. Stir in the remaining 3 tablespoons maple syrup, squeeze in the juice of the lime and add remaining ¼ teaspoon of salt. Remove from heat and carefully add the fruit, a couple of pieces at a time, swirling the pan to coat the pieces in syrup. The hot syrup may bubble and splatter, so be careful here. If the caramel forms hard clumps around the citrus slices, return the skillet to heat over medium-low and continue to cook, swirling the caramel around the citrus pieces, until any hard clumps dissolve, 2 minutes.
Step 6
Using a fine mesh sieve, strain the coconut milk into a medium bowl, pressing down on the aromatics in the sieve before discarding.
Step 7
To serve, scoop a few spoonfuls of the tapioca into shallow bowls. Ladle the infused coconut milk over the top, add several slices of citrus and spoon in some of the caramel glaze. Drizzle with some maple syrup and garnish with the crushed pistachio, if using.

tablespoon dark rum, brandy or bourbon
2
teaspoons pure vanilla extract
½
teaspoon coarse kosher salt

Freshly grated nutmeg, for dusting

Confectioners’ sugar, for dusting","1128 user ratings","1 hour 10 minutes, plus 30 minutes’ resting","Step 1
Have a rimmed dish or pan (about 1 inch deep) that fits the bread loaf snugly nearby. Using a serrated knife, slice a very thin layer (about 1/16 inch) off the bottom of the loaf to expose the surface for better batter absorption. Cut the top of the bread in 1½-inch-thick slices, being sure not to cut all the way through and leaving about ½ inch of bread at the bottom uncut. Then turn the loaf 90 degrees and cut 1½-inch slices in the other direction to make a grid-like pattern, again, not cutting all the way through. Transfer the cut loaf to the dish.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, sugar, cream, melted butter, rum, vanilla and salt until well combined. Slowly pour the batter into the loaf beginning in the center. Gently peel back all the pieces to drench every crevice and the top of the loaf with the batter. Allow to soak for 30 minutes at room temperature, or cover and refrigerate up to overnight.
Step 3
Heat the oven to 350 degrees, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
Step 4
Spoon any excess batter that has pooled into the dish back into the loaf and over any dry patches of bread. Carefully transfer the loaf to the lined baking sheet, and bake until the loaf is deeply golden brown on top and the custard has set, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and dust with the nutmeg and confectioners’ sugar. Serve immediately.

ounces dried kelp (dashima or kombu; see Tip)
4
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
1
(2½-pound) skinless halibut or cod fillet (1-inch thick; see Tip)

Kosher salt
1
(8-ounce) bottle clam juice
3
dozen mussels, cleaned (about 2 pounds)
2
tablespoons fresh lemon juice
½
teaspoon saffron, crumbled
2
small shallots, finely chopped
1
garlic clove, crushed
4
tablespoons unsalted butter
6
tablespoons heavy cream
1
tablespoon chopped parsley, plus more for garnish
1
tablespoon chopped tarragon, plus small leaves for garnish","236 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, combine kelp with 4 cups of cool water and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Reserve 2 cups of the kelp water.
Step 2
On a lightly greased rimmed sheet pan, arrange half of the softened kelp in the center, allowing excess water to drip off kelp and slightly overlapping the pieces. (Do not squeeze water out of the kelp). Rub halibut with 2 tablespoons of oil and season with salt. Set halibut in the center of the kelp and lift kelp over the sides of the fish. It should stick to the fish. Top halibut with the remaining kelp, slightly overlapping, and tuck the kelp loosely underneath the fish to enclose it.
Step 3
Roast halibut until just opaque in the center, about 15 minutes. A metal cake tester or skewer inserted in the center of the fish should feel warm to the touch. Transfer wrapped halibut to a serving platter.
Step 4
Meanwhile, in a large pot, combine clam juice and the reserved kelp water, and bring to a boil over high heat. Add mussels, cover and cook until mussels open, 2 to 3 minutes; begin checking mussels at 2 minutes and transfer them to a bowl as they open (discard any that do not open). Tent with foil to keep warm. Pour mussel broth into a separate bowl, leaving behind any grit in the pot, and reserve the broth. Rinse out pot to remove any grit.
Step 5
Combine 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice with the saffron in a small bowl and mix well. In the rinsed pot, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil over medium. Add shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add reserved mussel broth (and any juice that has drained from the mussels) and saffron-lemon juice, and bring to a boil over high. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently to allow flavors to meld, about 5 minutes. Discard garlic.
Step 6
While whisking constantly, add butter 1 tablespoon at a time, blending in each addition before adding the next. Then, whisk in heavy cream. Gently simmer until sauce is slightly reduced, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice, parsley and tarragon, and season with salt. You should have about 2 cups of sauce.
Step 7
Remove the top layer of kelp to reveal halibut. You can serve the kelp to eat with the fish or discard it. Arrange mussels around halibut, removing the top shells for easier eating if you’d like. Spoon some sauce over the mussels and fish, and garnish with parsley and tarragon.
Step 8
To serve, divide the fish and mussels among plates. Garnish with more parsley and tarragon. Serve with the remaining sauce on the side.
Dried kelp, known as dashima in Korean and kombu in Japanese, are thin sheets of dried seaweed sold in packs of squares or rectangles. You will need 5 to 6 large pieces from one 2-ounce package for this dish.
If you can’t find a single 2½-pound fillet, you can combine 2 smaller fillets. Just make sure they’re 1 inch thick.

In a large bowl, sprinkle the red onion with salt and stir to combine. In a medium bowl, stir together the cornstarch and 1 teaspoon salt. Add the tofu and toss to coat.
Step 2
Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Add the cabbage and cook, undisturbed, until charred underneath, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir, spread into an even layer, and cook, undisturbed, until charred in spots and crisp-tender, another 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the soy sauce, and season with salt. Transfer to the bowl of red onions.
Step 3
In the same skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high.

2
large shallots, halved lengthwise
2
large dried or fresh bay leaves
¼
packed cup dark brown sugar
4
teaspoons Dijon mustard
2
teaspoons rice vinegar","1150 user ratings","3½ hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Using a sharp knife, make parallel cuts across the surface of the ham, about ½ inch deep and 1 inch apart, then repeat in the opposite direction to create a diamond pattern.
Step 2
Place the ham in a deep, large roasting pan, cut side down, and pour the root beer over the ham. Add the shallots and bay leaves to the root beer in the roasting pan. Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and bake, basting once halfway through, until the ham is heated through (it’s already cooked). The internal temperature should reach 135 degrees, about 15 minutes per pound (2 to 3 hours total).
Step 3
When the ham is done heating through, carefully remove from the oven and raise the oven temperature to 400 degrees. Uncover the ham and ladle out 2 cups of the root beer braising liquid into a large skillet.
Step 4
To make the glaze, add the brown sugar, mustard and rice vinegar to the root beer in the skillet and bring to a boil, whisking occasionally and watching that it doesn’t boil over. Cook until reduced significantly, syrupy and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and drip off slowly, 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 5
Using a spoon or a brush, apply half of the glaze all over the surface of the ham. Bake, uncovered, until the glaze is bronzed, bubbling and gorgeous (but not burned), 8 to 12 minutes.
Step 6
Transfer the ham to a cutting board to rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing thinly and serving with the extra glaze. Carefully pour the braising liquid into a gravy boat and serve alongside, as well.

Chopped crystallized ginger, for decorating (optional)

Shaved chocolate, for decorating (optional)","310 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling and resting","Step 1
Make the cake: Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch light colored metal baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line it with a piece of parchment that hangs over the 2 long sides.
Step 2
In a large bowl, combine the sugar and eggs, and use an electric mixer on medium or a whisk to beat the mixture until light and foamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the buttermilk, molasses, butter and oil, and mix until combined and smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Step 3
Add the fresh ginger, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves and salt, and mix to incorporate.
Step 4
Add the flour, baking powder and baking soda, and mix until no streaks of dry ingredients remain, about 1 minute.
Step 5
Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan, and tap on the counter a few times to release any large bubbles. Bake until puffed and set, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 28 to 34 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan set on a rack for 15 minutes, then use the parchment paper overhang to lift the cake out of the pan. Set it on a rack to cool completely.
Step 6
While the cake is cooling, make the ganache: Add the chocolate and butter to a large bowl or to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. In a small saucepan, bring the cream to a simmer.
Step 7
Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and butter in the bowl, and whisk until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the vanilla extract and salt, and whisk until incorporated. Let the mixture sit until slightly thickened, about 1 hour.
Step 8
When the cake is cool and the ganache is thickened, whip the ganache on high speed until it’s lighter in both texture and color, fluffy, and holds soft peaks, about 10 minutes.
Step 9
Dollop the ganache over the cooled cake, and use a spoon to spread it over the cake in swoops and swirls. Top with chopped crystallized ginger or shaved chocolate if desired. Store leftover cake in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.

14
tablespoons/200 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes
2½
cups/350 grams all-purpose flour
1
packed cup/125 grams confectioners’ sugar
½
teaspoon fine sea salt

1½
teaspoons vanilla extract

½
cup/200 grams raspberry jam, jelly or preserves
2
cups/250 grams confectioners’ sugar
2
tablespoons hot water, plus more as needed

Finely chopped or crushed dried raspberries, or sprinkles, for garnish","816 user ratings","1 hour, plus chilling, cooling and resting","Step 1
Prepare the dough: In a medium bowl, toss together the butter and flour. Using a pastry cutter (or your fingertips), rub the butter bits into the flour until the mixture resembles cauliflower rice. Stir in the confectioners’ sugar and salt. (The mixture will look like very finely crumbled Parmesan at this point.)
Step 2
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and vanilla extract. Stir into the dough — or use a pastry cutter to integrate it — just until the mixture is smooth. (It may look like the mixture needs more liquid, but the butter and egg should suffice.) Take your hands and squeeze the dough a few times just until it comes together and appears fully hydrated (no dry white spots). Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (or overnight) before using.
Step 3
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Divide the chilled dough into two equal portions (each about 350 grams). Cut parchment paper to line two large baking sheets, plus a third piece of similar size to help roll out the dough. Working on one sheet of parchment at a time, roll out each portion of dough, sandwiching it between the extra sheet of parchment for ease, until roughly 10 inches wide, 12 inches long and a scant ¼-inch thick. (Expanding the dough uniformly requires even pressure applied to your rolling pin. If your dough is expanding in the wrong direction, trim outside portions and move the trimmed portion to a more desired central position, “gluing” it in place with your fingertips.) Prick each slab of dough all over with a fork to prevent it from puffing.
Step 4
Using the parchment paper to lift the dough, transfer each slab to a large baking sheet. Bake both until lightly golden, about 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer baking sheets to wire racks to cool, about 15 minutes.
Step 5
Once the cookies have cooled, spread one of them with the jam until evenly coated. Carefully set the other crust on top, pressing gently to adhere.
Step 6
Prepare the frosting: In a medium bowl, combine the confectioners’ sugar with 2 tablespoons hot water, and whisk to combine. The mixture should be as thick as loose honey; add more hot water by the teaspoonful if needed to achieve the desired consistency. Drizzle on top of the pastry, spreading all the way to the edges in an even layer.
Step 7
Sprinkle immediately with dried raspberries or sprinkles. (The frosting can firm up fairly quickly, so you’ll want to garnish it while the toppings can still stick.) Let sit until the frosting firms up, about 1 hour.
Step 8
Using a sharp knife, trim the edges of the pastry to form clean lines. (Reserve those to snack on.) Cut into squares or rectangles, in any size you fancy. Raspberry slices will keep a few days, covered, at room temperature — or in the refrigerator, if the weather is balmy (though they are best enjoyed at room temperature). If layering them for storage, separate each layer with parchment or wax paper to protect the frosting.

cup/90 grams all-purpose flour
¼
cup/41 grams crushed peppermint candy","2409 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Step 2
Put chocolate and ¼ cup/21 grams cocoa powder in a small heatproof bowl or glass measuring cup. Melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat until bubbly but not browned, and pour over the chocolate. Without stirring, let the mixture sit so the residual heat can melt the chocolate thoroughly while you whip the eggs and sugar.
Step 3
Put the eggs, both sugars and the salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Whisk on medium-high speed until the mixture is pillowy and the sugars have begun to dissolve, 6 to 8 minutes.
Step 4
Stir the chocolate mixture until glossy and smooth. If any solid pieces remain, you can microwave the mixture in 10-second bursts until everything is melted.
Step 5
With the mixer on low speed, add the peppermint extract and then the chocolate mixture. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl with a spatula, then add the flour and remaining ¼ cup/21 grams cocoa, and mix on low until a few streaks of flour and cocoa remain. Use the spatula to finish folding in the dry ingredients to avoid overmixing. The dough will be looser than traditional cookie dough but not as thin as brownie batter.
Step 6
Use a ¼-cup cookie scoop or measuring cup to scoop 12 (2-ounce) balls of batter onto the prepared sheets and bake. After 10 minutes, take the sheets out of the oven and bang them once on the counter to create a craggy surface and dense texture. Sprinkle a bit of crushed peppermint candy in the center of each cookie and return to the oven for another 2 minutes.
Step 7
Let cool completely on the baking sheets. The cookies will keep for 4 days in an airtight container at room temperature.

Position a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-inch springform pan.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, combine the flour, almond flour, brown sugar, salt, cloves and black pepper. Rub the butter into the flour mixture using your fingers until small pebbles form. (Alternatively, use a food processor to pulse the dry ingredients with the butter.) Pour the cream over the mixture, stir just until combined and squeeze until the dough forms ¾-inch clumps.

2
tablespoons grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
½
cup whole-milk ricotta (optional)","2787 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
In a medium Dutch oven, or a large (12-inch) skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the foam subsides, the milk solids turn golden brown and it smells nutty and toasty, 3 to 4 minutes. (Watch carefully to see that it doesn’t burn.)
Step 2
Stir in shallots and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Add squash, sage, a large pinch of salt, the ¼ teaspoon black pepper and the ¼ teaspoon red-pepper flakes, and cook until squash is golden at the edges and begins to soften, 12 to 17 minutes.
Step 3
Add stock and bring to a simmer. Stir in orzo, lemon zest and the 1 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and simmer over medium-low heat until orzo is just tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, 14 to 18 minutes, stirring once or twice. If the pan dries out before the orzo and squash are tender, add a splash or two of water.
Step 4
Remove pan from heat and stir in Parmesan. Taste and add more salt if needed, and a squeeze of lemon juice if the dish needs brightness. Dollop with ricotta if using, and sprinkle with more grated Parmesan and black pepper just before serving, garnishing the top with more red-pepper flakes and sage.

"Kaale Seerabeh Salad (Salad With Pomegranate Dressing)","Cilantro,Pomegranate Juice,Pomegranate Seed,Romaine Heart,Walnut,Appetizer,Side Dish,Winter,Vegan,Vegetarian","Yield: 6 servings","For the Dressing
1
cup pomegranate juice, plus more as needed

2
large garlic cloves, coarsely chopped
2
tablespoons lemon juice, plus more as needed
1
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
¼

For Assembly
2
romaine lettuce hearts, or 4 to 6 heads Little Gem lettuce
2
large radishes (watermelon, red, white or daikon, or a mixture), thinly sliced into rounds
1
large carrot (preferably purple), peeled and sliced into ¼-inch-thick rounds
1
large orange, segmented

Kosher salt

Bread, for serving","54 user ratings","10 minutes, plus 24 hours’ marinating","Step 1
Prepare the dressing: Place the pomegranate juice, pomegranate seeds, walnuts, garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper in a blender, and blend until smooth. Add the cilantro, mint and parsley, and blend until smooth. With the blender running on low, drizzle in the olive oil. Taste and adjust seasoning. If the sauce is too sour, sprinkle in a little sugar; if it’s not acidic enough, add a little more pomegranate juice or lemon juice, one tablespoon at a time. Be mindful that the flavors will meld more and pop as the sauce rests. Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh strainer, and discard any tiny bits of pomegranate seeds. You should have 1¾ cups. Transfer the sauce to a container, cover and refrigerate overnight. (The sauce can be made up to 5 days in advance.) The sauce will thicken slightly as it rests, but it’s not a thick sauce.
Step 2
Assemble the salad: Remove the larger outer leaves of the romaine hearts and set aside for another use. On a serving platter or on individual plates, neatly arrange the lettuce leaves, stacking some on top of one another. (If using Little Gems, just halve them lengthwise and place on the platter; no need to stack them.) Or, chop the lettuce if you’d prefer. Scatter the radishes, carrots and orange segments on top. Sprinkle everything with a little salt. Stir the sauce to combine, and taste for seasoning and acidity. Drizzle over the salad and serve right away. Use as much sauce as desired. Serve with a side of bread to sop up any lingering dressing.

"No-Bake Chocolate Clusters","Christmas Cookie,Cornflake,Dried Cranberry,White Chocolate,Dessert,Christmas","Yield: 40 cookies","6 or 8
tablespoons/85 or 113 grams unsalted butter, cut into chunks
12
ounces/340 grams white chocolate bars, chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips
4
cups/113 grams cornflakes
1
cup/120 grams moist, plump dried cranberries (see Tip)
⅓
cup/25 grams unsweetened shredded coconut (optional)

Fleur de sel or fine sea salt, for finishing

Sprinkles, for finishing (optional)","322 user ratings","20 minutes, plus chilling","Step 1
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat or with 40 mini-muffin liners.
Step 2
If you’re using white chocolate, use 6 tablespoons/85 grams butter. For semisweet chocolate, use 8 tablespoons/113 grams butter. Put the butter in a small saucepan, top with the chocolate and cook over very low heat, stirring almost constantly, until smooth. (Alternatively, you can stir in a heatproof bowl set over simmering water or in a microwave-safe bowl in a microwave, stirring in 20-second increments.)
Step 3
Meanwhile, toss the cornflakes, cranberries and coconut, if using, in a large bowl. Pour over the melted chocolate and gently stir in with a flexible spatula. Some of the cereal will break — it’s inevitable — but keep working until you’ve coated all of the flakes.
Step 4
Use a medium cookie scoop or two spoons to shape sweets either on the lined baking sheet or in the paper liners. Gently press the mixture into the scoop or a spoon, binding the elements, before releasing the scoop or scraping the mixture off the spoon with another spoon onto the sheet or into the liners. Finish with salt and sprinkles, if using.
Step 5
Refrigerate or freeze (my preference) for about 30 minutes, or until set, before serving. To keep, cover and refrigerate for up to a week or freeze for up to a month. These are good straight from the fridge or just a few minutes out of the freezer.
If you have only dry, sad cranberries, plump them: Cover them with hot water in a bowl, leave for a minute or two, then drain and pat dry. I make these with just cranberries, but you could mix up the add-ins and include unsweetened coconut, snipped dried apricots or cherries, toasted pecans, walnuts or slivered almonds. All together, whatever you add to the cornflakes should be roughly 1 cup/120 grams total.

"Khoresh Morgh Nardooni (Pomegranate Chicken Stew)","Poultry,Chicken Leg,Pomegranate Molasses,Pomegranate Seed,Saffron,Main Course,Winter","Yield: 4 servings","
A pinch of saffron threads (about ¾ teaspoon)

A pinch of granulated sugar, plus more as needed
4
bone-in, skin-on chicken legs (about 3 pounds)

Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
¼
cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1
large yellow onion, diced
¾
teaspoon ground turmeric
¼
teaspoon black pepper, plus more as needed
1
tablespoon tomato paste
2
tablespoons pomegranate molasses (see Tip)
1½
cups pomegranate seeds (from 1 large pomegranate)

Lemon juice, as needed

Mint leaves, for garnishing (optional)

Steamed rice, fresh herbs, sliced radishes and scallion segments, for serving","476 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Bring 2 tablespoons water to a boil in a small saucepan, kettle or using the microwave, then let stand for 2 minutes to allow the temperature to drop slightly while you grind the saffron. Using a mortar and pestle (or small bowl with the handle of a wooden spoon), grind the saffron with a small pinch of sugar to a fine powder (about ¼ teaspoon) and add the hot water. Gently stir, cover and let steep until ready to use.
Step 2
Season the chicken legs generously with salt (about 3½ teaspoons). In a large skillet with a lid, heat ¼ cup of oil over medium-high. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, reduce the heat to medium and add the chicken legs, skin side down. Cook until the chicken is golden, 5 to 8 minutes; we’re not looking to brown the chicken skin here, just to get a nice golden color. Flip and cook the other side until golden, 5 to 8 minutes. You may have to do this in batches. Transfer the chicken to a sheet pan or large plate.
Step 3
Leave behind about ¼ cup of the rendered fat in the pan and discard the rest. Add half of the diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the onion with a little salt, ½ teaspoon of turmeric and the black pepper, and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Step 4
Transfer the chicken legs along with any juices back to the pan skin side down. Swipe the chicken through the turmeric-stained oil and flip so the skin side is up. Add 1½ cups water, scraping up any bits stuck on the bottom. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and gently simmer the chicken for 25 minutes.
Step 5
Meanwhile, prepare the pomegranate sauce: In a small pan, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium. Add the remaining diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the onion with a little salt, add remaining ¼ teaspoon of turmeric, and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Reduce the heat to medium-low, stir in the tomato paste, and cook just to take off the raw taste and deepen its color, but taking care not to burn it, about 1 minute. Add the pomegranate molasses, give it a quick stir just to incorporate (pomegranate molasses burns quickly), then stir in 1¼ cups pomegranate seeds and save the rest for garnish. Sprinkle with a little salt, and remove from the heat.
Step 6
Add the pomegranate sauce and the saffron water to the chicken, gently stir, and simmer uncovered over medium heat until the sauce reduces by about half and the chicken is tender, about 25 minutes. Every once in a while, spoon a little sauce over the chicken. If the sauce reduces too quickly, reduce the heat to medium-low or low. (You want enough sauce to spoon over rice and the chicken.) Taste for seasoning, and add a little sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the pomegranate molasses is too sour or bitter. If your sauce is too sweet, balance it with a little lemon juice, 1 tablespoon at a time.
Step 7
Garnish with reserved pomegranate seeds and mint leaves, and serve over rice with a side of fresh herbs, radishes and scallions.
The flavor and tartness of pomegranate molasses varies by brand. Before cooking, make sure you taste it to get an idea of how tart, bitter or sweet yours is; you can always balance it with a little sugar, if necessary. Sadaf sour pomegranate molasses has a nice balance. If you use Cortas, keep in mind that it is quite strong and a little bitter.

¼
cup/50 grams granulated sugar
2
teaspoons ground ginger","1919 user ratings","35 minutes, plus 2½ hours’ chilling","Step 1
In a medium saucepan over medium, melt butter until foamy, about 3 minutes. Continue cooking butter, stirring and scraping frequently with a stiff silicone spatula, until the sputtering has subsided and the butter solids look deeply browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, then whisk in the fresh ginger and ground spices. Scrape the butter and any brown bits at the bottom into the bowl of a stand mixer (or into a large bowl if using a hand mixer). Set aside until cool, slightly solid, but still creamy, about 20 minutes in the refrigerator or 2 hours at room temperature.
Step 2
Add confectioners’ sugar, molasses, vanilla, salt and baking soda to the cooled butter. Mix on low with the paddle attachment, stopping once to scrape the bowl and paddle, until creamy and combined, about 1 minute.
Step 3
Add the egg and mix on medium until pale and fluffy, stopping once to scrape the bowl and paddle, about 2 minutes. Add flour and mix until evenly combined, about 30 seconds. Cover and chill for at least 2 hours and up to 3 days before baking.
Step 4
Prepare the sugar coating: In a small bowl, stir together the sugar and ground ginger. Line two sheet pans with parchment paper, arrange the racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven, and heat oven to 375 degrees.
Step 5
Using a #40 cookie scoop or two spoons, scoop the cookie dough into 2-tablespoon portions (30 grams). Roll the portioned cookie dough into balls and coat in the ginger sugar. Arrange on the sheet tray at least 1 inch apart and bake until set and lightly browned around the edges, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.
Cookies are best eaten the day they are baked. Cookie dough portions can be frozen, then coated in sugar and baked from frozen as needed. No need to thaw; bake frozen portions for 11 to 13 minutes.

ounces/116 grams cream cheese, softened

tablespoons granulated sugar
¾
teaspoon fine sea salt

large egg, yolk and white separated
1
cup/130 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling dough
11⅓
ounces/320 grams guava paste (see Tip)

Sparkling sugar, for sprinkling (optional)","351 user ratings","1½ hours, plus 2 hours’ chilling","Step 1
Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed or a large bowl and wooden spoon, beat butter and cream cheese until creamy and smooth. With the machine running, add sugar and salt, and continue beating until a little fluffy. Add egg yolk and beat until incorporated. (Reserve egg white.) Add flour all at once and mix just until incorporated. Halve the dough, and place each half on plastic wrap. Using the plastic wrap, press each half into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours.
Step 2
When ready to bake, cut guava paste into 50 ¼-inch-thick rectangles (2 inches long, ½-inch wide). Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 3
On a generously floured surface, using a well-floured rolling pin, roll out 1 dough rectangle until roughly 15½ inches long, 6½ inches wide and ⅛-inch thick. Trim the edges, then cut into 24 (2½-by-1½-inch) rectangles. (You will have 48 rectangles from the initial rolling; the final two rectangles will come from rolled-out scraps.) Transfer to a prepared sheet, spacing 1 inch apart. If the dough has gotten too soft to handle, refrigerate until firmer but still very pliable.
Step 4
Place a guava paste rectangle in the center of each piece of dough on a diagonal. (It should not extend past the dough.) Take the dough corner opposite the top of a guava rectangle and wrap it over the guava paste so that the point meets the opposite edge; press the dough corner gently to secure. Take the corner diagonally opposite to the folded one and fold over the other end of the guava paste, pressing the corner gently against the other edge. Repeat with the remaining dough and guava paste. Chill and reroll dough scraps. If the assembled dough is soft, and you’d like to decorate the tops, chill or freeze again.
Step 5
For a sparkly, crunchy and sweet top, lightly brush the top of the dough with the reserved egg white and sprinkle with sparkling sugar. (These taste just as good without any topping.) Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until golden brown around the edges, 13 to 15 minutes. (The paste may ooze out.) Cool completely on the sheets on wire racks. The cookies are best the day they’re made, but will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
It’s easiest to cut rectangles from rectangular guava paste blocks. If you can find only rounds, trim the edges and save for another use. Guava paste is available in many markets and also online.

For Finishing
2
tablespoons Demerara sugar, for sprinkling

Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling

Milk, for brushing","474 user ratings","1½ hours, plus chilling","Step 1
Make the dough: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or a hand-held electric mixer, beat cream cheese and butter on medium speed until smooth and well blended. Beat in sugar and vanilla extract. Reduce speed to low, and gradually add flour and salt until just incorporated.
Step 2
Scrape dough onto plastic wrap. Divide dough into 4 portions, form each into a disk and wrap each in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 2 hours or up to 5 days.
Step 3
Prepare the fudge: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine sugar, cream, and salt. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar dissolves completely, about 5 minutes. Scrape mixture into a bowl. Add chocolate, butter and vanilla, and let sit for 5 minutes to soften the chocolate, then mix until melted and smooth. (Fudge can be made up to 2 weeks ahead and stored, covered, in the refrigerator. Let come to room temperature before using; it’s too firm to spread when cold.)
Step 4
Make the crumb filling: In a small bowl, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa powder and salt. Stir in melted butter until it is evenly distributed and the mixture forms large, moist crumbs. Set aside.
Step 5
Line 4 baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick liners, or lightly butter the pans, if you like. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, remove it from refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes, or until malleable enough to roll out.
Step 6
On a clean, lightly floured work surface, roll out dough into a 9-inch circle, about ⅛-inch thick. Rotate dough while rolling to ensure it does not stick to the work surface.
Step 7
Using the back of a spoon, evenly spread 2 tablespoons of fudge onto the rolled-out dough. Sprinkle about ½ cup of sugar cocoa crumbs over fudge. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of chopped nuts over the crumbs, and, using your hands, press the filling firmly and evenly into the dough.
Step 8
Using a sharp knife, cut the dough circle into 12 triangles, like pieces of a pie. With an offset spatula or thin knife, loosen the triangles from the work surface. Starting at the wide end of the triangle and working to the narrow tip, roll up each piece and bend the ends around to form a slight crescent shape.
Step 9
Place rugelach, narrow tip tucked beneath, on a prepared baking sheet, leaving about 1½ inches between each. Refrigerate, lightly covered with plastic wrap, for at least 30 minutes (and up to 24 hours) to help them keep their shape in the oven. Repeat with the remaining dough, fudge and filling. (Clean your work surface before rolling out the next batch of dough.)
Step 10
When ready to bake, heat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together Demerara sugar and a large pinch of flaky salt. Brush rugelach with milk and sprinkle sugar-salt mix on top.
Step 11
Bake, 2 sheets at a time, until lightly browned, 17 to 25 minutes. Rotate cookie sheets halfway through for even baking. Transfer sheets to a wire rack to cool completely.

Place racks in the upper and lower thirds of an oven and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 sheet pans with parchment paper.
Step 2
In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and baking soda, and set aside.
Step 3
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer, cream together the sugar and butter on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the tahini and mix on medium speed until well combined, stopping to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed with a rubber spatula.
Step 4
Add the egg, egg yolk, vanilla extract and salt to the butter-tahini mixture, and mix on medium speed until emulsified, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure the dough is evenly mixed.
Step 5
Add the flour mixture, and mix on low speed until just combined and no streaks of flour remain. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure the dough is evenly mixed.
Step 6
Roll the cookies into tablespoon-size balls and place them on the baking sheets about 2 inches apart.
Step 7
Bake the cookies for 7 minutes, then remove them from the oven and very carefully use your thumb or the handle of a wooden spoon to make a teaspoon-size indent in the center of each cookie. The cookies will crack slightly along the edges; that’s OK. Return the cookies to the oven, rotating the pans from front to back and top to bottom. Bake until the cookies are set and just barely golden at the edges, another 5 to 7 minutes. Set the pans on cooling racks and press on the indentations slightly if they have puffed up during the baking process. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes.
Step 8
Use a small spoon or pastry bag to fill the indentation of each cookie with about 1 teaspoon of dulce de leche, and sprinkle with flaky salt, if using. Let cool completely on the pans. Store in a single layer in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

In a bowl, combine the oats, flour and salt. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat both sugars with the egg, cinnamon, vanilla and baking soda on high speed, scraping the bowl as needed, until glossy, pale and thick, a full 2 minutes. Reduce the speed to medium. Very slowly drizzle in the melted butter and whisk until thoroughly incorporated. Add the oat mixture and gently fold by hand using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula just until incorporated, being careful not to overmix.
Step 3
Using a small cookie scoop or two spoons, drop 15 golf ball-size mounds of dough onto the sheet pan, spacing them at least 2 inches apart. Bake until the edges and surface are set and lightly golden brown, but the center is still gooey, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately rap the cookie sheet on the counter or stovetop a couple of times to help the cookies flatten a little more, and cool on the sheet for 5 minutes.
Step 4
In a small bowl, mix the confectioners’ sugar and milk using a fork until the icing is completely smooth and very thick but still moves if you tilt the bowl. Add more milk in small increments as needed. Dip only the very tops of the cookies into the bowl of icing, leaving the deeper cracks in the cookies uncoated and allowing any excess icing to drip back into the bowl.

"Torticas de Morón","Cuban,Christmas Cookie,Lime Zest,Shortening,Dessert,Christmas","Yield: About 2 dozen cookies","1
cup/185 grams vegetable shortening
1
cup/200 grams granulated sugar
½
teaspoon vanilla extract

Zest of 3 limes (about 1½ tablespoons lime zest)
3
cups/385 grams all-purpose flour
1
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)","222 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
In a large bowl and using a wooden spoon, combine the shortening and the sugar until well incorporated. Add the vanilla extract, and stir until combined. Add the lime zest and stir until incorporated.
Step 2
Gradually add the flour and salt in three batches, using your hands to mix and press the ingredients together between each addition, until all the flour is absorbed and the mixture forms a cohesive dough. If the dough doesn't come together, mix in a splash of lime juice or water.
Step 3
Heat oven to 325 degrees. Clear off part of your work surface, and lay down a 2-foot-long piece of plastic wrap.
Step 4
Transfer the dough to the center of the plastic wrap, and form the dough into a log that is 2 inches in diameter. (Use the long sides of the plastic wrap to help you roll and form. This may be tricky, but just keep squishing and rolling the dough until it all comes together.) Wrap the dough tightly in the plastic wrap so you have a compact, circular log, and let rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.
Step 5
Uncover the dough and, using a sharp knife, cut into ½-inch slices. (If the slices crumble, feel free to push them back together, or to use your fingers to smooth out any rough edges so that they’re more round.) Place the slices on a nonstick baking sheet or a rimmed baking sheet covered in parchment paper, and bake until firm at the center and light golden brown on the bottom, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool completely, and serve. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

large egg
6
tablespoons/85 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons

Confectioners’ sugar and finely grated lime zest, for serving","409 user ratings","1½ hours, plus 1 hour’s cooling","Step 1
Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line an 8-inch square pan, preferably metal, with 2 sheets of aluminum foil, crossing one over the other and pressing the foil into the corners and up the sides. Butter the bottom and sides of the foil, and set the pan aside.
Step 2
Make the shortbread crust: In a medium bowl, use your fingertips to massage the lime zest into the sugar until the fragrant oils are released and the mixture looks like wet sand. Add the flour, chopped mint, baking powder and salt, and toss to combine. Add the ½-inch pieces of chilled butter and toss to coat in the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to smash the butter into the flour mixture, working until no large pieces remain and you have lots of moist crumbs that hold together easily when squeezed.
Step 3
Bake the crust: Scatter the shortbread dough evenly across the bottom of the prepared pan. Use your hands to flatten the crumbs into an even layer, working it into the corners and against the sides. Bake the shortbread until lightly golden across the surface, about 30 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven. (Leave the oven on and reduce the temperature to 300 degrees.) Let the crust cool while you make the filling.
Step 4
Make the lime curd filling: In a small saucepan, combine the lime juice, lemon juice, cornstarch, salt and ½ cup/100 grams of the granulated sugar, and cook over medium heat, whisking occasionally, to dissolve the sugar. When the mixture comes to a boil, whisk constantly until it thickens slightly from the cornstarch, about 1 minute, then remove the saucepan from the heat.
Step 5
In a medium bowl, vigorously whisk the egg yolks, whole egg and remaining ½ cup/100 grams sugar until the mixture is smooth, thick and has paled in color a couple of shades, about 1 minute. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle the hot citrus mixture into the eggs a tablespoon at a time to slowly raise the temperature, until you’ve added about half the citrus mixture to the eggs.
Step 6
Whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan, then set back over medium-low heat and cook, whisking constantly, until the curd turns opaque, is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and barely hold the marks of the whisk (it will register 170 degrees on an instant-read thermometer), about 5 minutes. Remove the curd from the heat and whisk in the butter a piece at a time, waiting until each piece melts before adding the next, until the mixture is smooth.
Step 7
Bake the bars: Pour the hot curd over the crust and shake the pan gently so it settles in an even layer. Bake the bars until the sides have puffed and the center is set but still a bit wobbly when you shake the pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the bars cool completely in the pan
Step 8
Chill before serving: Transfer the cooled pan to the refrigerator and chill until the bottom of the pan is cold to the touch, about 1 hour. This will harden the butter in both the curd and crust, making it easier to remove the bars from the pan and slice.
Step 9
Use the edges of the foil to lift the bars out of the pan, then peel down the sides of the foil and slide a metal spatula underneath to loosen the crust from the foil. Slide the bars off the foil onto a cutting board and slice into 16 squares. Dust with confectioners’ sugar and top with more lime zest before serving. They are best eaten on the first or second day, but will keep for up to 5 days stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

For the Glaze
1
cup/123 grams confectioners’ sugar, sifted
½
teaspoon almond extract
3 to 4
tablespoons heavy cream

Sprinkles","252 user ratings","2 hours, plus chilling","Step 1
Prepare the pastry: Combine the flour, confectioners’ sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles a coarse meal. Add the egg yolks and cream, and pulse just until the dough starts to come together. Add more cream if necessary, but stop before the dough is too wet. Tip the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap and form it into a ball, divide in two and wrap each half in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 2 hours.
Step 2
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: In a small saucepan, combine the figs, cherries and 1¼ cups water, and bring to a low simmer over medium heat. Cook until the figs are very soft, about 15 minutes, adding a little more water as necessary to make a moist paste. Transfer to the bowl of a food processor and add the almonds, brown sugar, rum, orange zest, cinnamon and salt, and pulse until you have a relatively smooth paste. (You should have about 1¼ cups filling.) Let cool completely.
Step 3
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Working with 1 ball at a time, roll the dough out to ⅛-inch thickness on a very lightly floured surface. Use a 2¼-inch cookie cutter to cut out circles. Transfer the circles to the prepared baking sheet. Scoop about a scant tablespoon of filling onto half of the dough circles. Brush the edges of the filled circles with a bit of cream and top with another dough circle, gently pressing the edges to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. (If the dough becomes too soft, pop it into the fridge to firm up before continuing.) You can reroll and cut the dough scraps one time.
Step 4
Chill the pies for 10 minutes. Use a fork to crimp all of the edges. (If you’d like to neaten the edges, you can go over the cookies again with the cookie cutter.) Refrigerate the cookies for at least 30 more minutes. While the cookies chill, heat the oven to 350 degrees.
Step 5
Brush the top of each cookie with cream. Bake until they’re golden and crisp, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool completely.
Step 6
Prepare the glaze: In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, almond extract and 3 tablespoons cream. The icing should be spreadable. If it isn’t, stir in another tablespoon cream. Spread a bit of the glaze on each cookie and top with sprinkles. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days or freeze for a month.
You can make the pastry, wrap it well and refrigerate it up to 3 days before you use it, or you can freeze it for up to 1 month. The filling can be made up to 3 days ahead as well. Some say the filling tastes even better after a short rest, but it isn’t essential.

1¾
cups/224 grams all-purpose flour
For the Coating
¾
cup/93 grams confectioners’ sugar
3
tablespoons/20 grams finely ground freeze-dried fruit","620 user ratings","30 minutes, plus 2 hours’ chilling","Step 1
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, or in a large bowl with a stiff spatula, mix butter, confectioners’ sugar, salt, lemon juice and vanilla until creamy and combined. Add ground freeze-dried fruit and mix until distributed. Add flour, and mix until it all comes together into a soft dough.
Step 2
Divide the dough into two (250-gram) portions. On pieces of parchment paper, wax paper or plastic wrap, roll each portion of dough into a 10-inch-long log. Chill for at least 2 hours in the refrigerator or up to 3 months tightly wrapped in the freezer.
Step 3
Set oven racks in the lower and upper thirds of the oven, and heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two sheet trays with parchment paper.
Step 4
Using a sharp knife, trim about ⅛-inch off each side of the chilled dough logs, just so that you have flat ends. Slice the logs into scant ¼-inch-thick cookies. Roll the log a quarter turn after each slice to keep it round. (If the dough cracks while slicing, let it warm up at room temperature for 10 minutes.) Arrange on sheet trays ½-inch apart and bake, rotating the trays once during baking, until set and barely golden underneath, 10 to 12 minutes.
Step 5
While the cookies bake, make the sugar coating: Sift together the powdered sugar with the ground freeze-dried fruit. While still warm, gently toss the cookies in the powdered sugar mixture and return to the sheet tray to fully cool. The cookies will keep for 2 weeks stored at room temperature in an airtight container.

1
teaspoon vanilla extract
¼
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
2
cups/240 grams confectioners’ sugar","593 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Make the cookies: In a food processor, process the toffee bits, sugar, baking soda and salt until the toffee is mostly ground and the mixture is sandy, about 1 minute.
Step 2
Transfer the toffee mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer (or a large bowl if using a hand mixer). Add butter, egg white and vanilla. Mix together with the paddle attachment on medium until creamy and fluffy, stopping once to scrape the bowl and paddle, about 2 minutes. Add flour, and mix on medium-low until the mixture comes together into a soft dough, about 30 seconds.
Step 3
Divide the dough in half. Pat each half into a disk. (If the dough is very soft, wrap and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes before proceeding.) Line three sheet trays with parchment paper.
Step 4
Dust the counter and dough with flour. Working with one piece of dough at a time, use a rolling pin to roll the dough out until just under ⅛-inch thick (the thickness of two stacked pennies), turning the dough frequently to ensure it moves freely on the counter and dusting with more flour as needed. Each sheet of dough will be about the size of a standard sheet of paper.
Step 5
Using a 2-inch round cookie cutter dusted in flour, cut out cookies from one sheet of dough. Using an offset spatula, transfer rounds to a prepared sheet tray, leaving about ½ inch of space between cookies.
Step 6
Repeat with the remaining sheet of dough. Gather and knead together any scraps, reroll and repeat until all the dough has been rolled out for a total of 72 cookies. Freeze on sheet trays for at least 30 minutes before baking. (Alternatively, once the cookies have firmly frozen, stack them between parchment in a freezer-safe container or zipper-lock bag for up to 3 months.)
Step 7
Set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Whisk together the egg yolk with 1 tablespoon of water and evenly brush on the tops of half of the chilled cookies. Sprinkle the yolk-brushed cookies with almonds, pressing gently to adhere. Bake the first two trays of cookies until deeply browned like a pretzel, switching the sheet trays from top to bottom and rotating from front to back halfway through, 10 to 14 minutes. Repeat with the third and final batch. Let cookies cool completely on sheet trays.
Step 8
Once the cookies are cool, make the icing: Set a piping bag in a tall and narrow container, like a deli quart container, and fold over the top edge to secure. Flip over the cookies without almonds. (You need to pipe the icing onto the cookies immediately after mixing, so make sure you are set up.)
Step 9
In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt butter until foamy, about 3 minutes. Continue cooking butter, stirring and scraping frequently with a stiff silicone spatula, until the sputtering has subsided and the butter solids look deeply browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape the butter and any brown bits into the bowl of a stand mixer (or into a large bowl if mixing by hand).
Step 10
Stir in the vanilla and salt. Sift over the powdered sugar. With the paddle attachment, mix on low until creamy and combined, about 1 minute, stopping once during mixing to scrape the bowl and the paddle. (You can also mix with a stiff silicone spatula until creamy and combined.)
Step 11
Transfer the icing to the piping bag and cut a 1-inch wide opening at the tip. Pipe a scant tablespoon of filling onto a flipped cookie and immediately top with an almond-topped cookie. Gently press to adhere so that the filling reaches the edges of the cookie. Repeat with remaining cookies and icing. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 month.

Heat the oven to 325 degrees. In a medium saucepan, combine the butter, rosemary sprig and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. Cook over medium, swirling occasionally, until the butter is just melted. (You can also do this in a bowl in the microwave, stirring between 30-second bursts). Set aside to cool slightly. (Take a whiff of the butter; it smells like rosemary!)
Step 2
In an ungreased 9-by-13-by-2-inch pan, use a fork to stir together the flour, sugar and cayenne until combined. Remove and discard the rosemary sprig from the butter. Pour the melted butter into the dry ingredients. Stir with a fork to combine, then use your hands to mix until no dry spots remain.
Step 3
Press the dough evenly into the pan. Prick all over with a fork. Sprinkle the nuts and rosemary leaves on top, shake into a single layer, then press firmly into the dough until the nuts’ sides are surrounded by dough. (This is important, otherwise the nuts won’t adhere.) Sprinkle evenly with 1 teaspoon sugar and the remaining ½ teaspoon black pepper.
Step 4
Bake until golden brown (including in the center) and the edges start to pull away from the sides, 35 to 40 minutes.
Step 5
Let cool completely, then gently break up with your hands into jagged pieces. Nuts along the edge may fall out. (Those are yours to eat.) The shortbread will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week.

8
ounces/227 grams semisweet or bittersweet bar chocolate

Sprinkles, for finishing (optional)","716 user ratings","About 2 hours, plus overnight chilling","Step 1
Arrange 2 racks in the center of the oven and heat to 350 degrees. Make room in your refrigerator for 1 half-sheet pan. Grease 3 (13-by-9-inch) baking pans or quarter-sheet pans with cooking spray or a little oil, then line with parchment or wax paper. (This helps the paper stay in place.) Spray or oil the parchment.
Step 2
Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl. In the bowl of a standing mixer (or with a hand mixer), or in a large bowl if using an electric hand mixer, break up the almond paste using a fork or your fingers. Add butter, sugar, egg yolks and almond extract. Using the paddle attachment, beat on high until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes, scraping down the bowl halfway through. Turn off the mixer, add a third of the flour and salt, then beat on medium-low until just combined. Repeat with another third, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, and continue until all the flour is added and incorporated. Transfer batter to a large bowl. Rinse and dry the mixing bowl.
Step 3
Add egg whites to the mixing bowl and beat on high speed with the whisk attachment until stiff peaks form, 30 to 45 seconds. Fold the egg whites into the batter until just combined.
Step 4
Remove one-third of the batter to one of the prepared pans. Use an offset spatula to evenly spread the batter in the pan all the way to the edges. (This can get a little tricky, but have patience and take your time. The oil on the pan should help hold the paper in place, but if you’re having trouble, hold the paper in place with one hand while you spread with the other.) Remove another one-third of the batter to a medium bowl and add a couple drops of green food coloring. Stir until blended, and add more to reach your desired shade. Transfer green batter to a prepared pan and spread evenly. Add a couple drops of red food coloring to the remaining batter, stir to combine, add more as needed, then transfer to the last pan and spread evenly. Firmly tap each pan on the countertop to release air bubbles.
Step 5
Bake for 10 to 11 minutes, rotating pans halfway through, until the edges are barely browned, the tops are just set, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Immediately slide cakes from the pans onto racks using the parchment paper. Cool completely.
Step 6
Using the parchment paper, slide the green cake onto a half-sheet pan. In a small saucepan, heat preserves over medium until loose, then strain through a fine mesh sieve. Spread half of the preserves over the green layer, going all the way to the edge. Carefully flip the uncolored layer on top (use a large offset spatula to help), and remove the parchment paper. Spread with the remaining preserves. Top with the red layer and remove the parchment paper. Cover with plastic wrap and place another rimmed baking sheet on top of the cookies. Transfer to the refrigerator, then top with heavy cans so the weight is evenly distributed. Refrigerate overnight.
Step 7
Melt half of the chocolate in a double boiler or in the microwave in 30-second bursts. Using an offset spatula, spread the chocolate on the top and to the edges, then refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes. Melt the remaining chocolate. Place a piece of parchment or wax paper on a cutting board, then place on top of the cake and invert the cake onto the board. Spread the bottom with the remaining chocolate. Let cool for a few minutes, then use the tines of a fork to draw waves in the chocolate and add sprinkles, if desired. Refrigerate until almost firm, but still slightly soft, about 5 to 10 minutes. (If you wait until the chocolate is fully set, the chocolate will crack when you cut.)
Step 8
Run a sharp knife under hot water, dry, then trim the edges and save for snacking. Cut the cake into 1-inch squares, running the knife under hot water and drying between cuts. Return to the refrigerator to set completely. Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container with wax paper between layers. Allow to come to room temperature a bit before serving.
You can find packaged almond paste in the baking supplies aisle at the grocery store.

tablespoons/18 grams finely ground dried hibiscus (from ¼ cup dried hibiscus flowers)
1
tablespoon fresh orange zest
2
tablespoons dried edible flower petals, such as rose (optional)","342 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes, plus chilling dough","Step 1
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and sugar. Beat on medium until light and fluffy, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 5 minutes. Add 1 egg and mix until just combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
Step 2
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, candied ginger, salt and ground ginger, and whisk together. Turn the mixer off, add flour mix to the butter all at once and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer speed to low and beat until flour is fully incorporated, scraping the bowl again if needed, about 30 seconds. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap, pressing down to form a flat square. Refrigerate the dough until firm, about 30 minutes.
Step 3
In a small bowl, combine the turbinado sugar, hibiscus, edible flowers (if using) and orange zest.
Step 4
Roll the dough between two sheets of parchment paper into a 10-by-13-inch rectangle. Peel off the top sheet of parchment paper. Beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl, and brush the surface of the dough with the egg mixture. Sprinkle the hibiscus mixture over the dough, leaving a ½-inch border along one of the long edges. Press down lightly on the sugar to make sure it adheres to the dough. Turn the dough so that the coated long end is closest to you and, starting from that end, roll the dough into a tight log. Use the bottom sheet of parchment to help lift and roll the dough. Slice the log in equal halves, and wrap each half with 1 sheet of parchment. Refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to slice, at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.
Step 5
Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Slice each log into ½-inch rounds. Lay the rounds on the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least ½-inch apart.
Step 6
Bake until the cookies are golden at the bottom edges, rotating once halfway through baking, about 22 minutes. Move the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Store the cookies at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The baked cookies can also be stored frozen in an airtight container for up to 10 days. Thaw at room temperature before serving.

¼
cup/35 grams diced (¼-inch) crystallized ginger
⅔
cup/113 grams dark or semisweet chocolate, finely chopped (4 ounces)","614 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes, plus cooling ","Step 1
Heat the oven to 325 degrees and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
Step 2
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the egg, egg white, both sugars, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cardamom, star anise, espresso powder, salt, baking soda, almond extract and lemon extract. Beat on medium speed just to combine, scrape down the bowl and beater, then increase the speed to high and beat for a full 90 seconds or until the mixture is slightly paler, thick and ribbony.
Step 3
Add the flour and the candied ginger. Beat on low speed until mostly combined, stopping the beater just before all the flour is incorporated so you don’t overmix. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to incorporate any remaining dry bits into the dough.
Step 4
Gather the dough with your hands, kneading lightly in the bowl just to bring everything together into a cohesive mass. Place the dough on the center of the prepared sheet, then dampen your hands with water and mold the dough into a 9-by-4-inch log about 1 inch tall. Bake until the log puffs and spreads a little, turns golden brown at the edges and is firm to the touch, 40 to 45 minutes.
Step 5
Remove the loaf from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Transfer the loaf to a cutting board and, using a serrated knife, cut at a diagonal into 12 (¾-inch-wide) slices. Turn the slices on their sides and return to the oven.
Step 6
Bake, flipping the slices halfway through, until slightly browned and dry in the centers, 10 to 15 minutes. Bake longer for drier, crunchier biscotti. Remove from the oven and cool the biscotti on the sheet. Turn the slices top sides up.
Step 7
In a double-boiler or a heatproof bowl set over simmering water, melt the chocolate, stirring until completely smooth. (See Tip.) Remove the bowl from the heat, and using a small spoon, drape the melted chocolate over the tops of the biscotti, nudging some to drip over the edges. Allow the chocolate to sit at room temperature or in the refrigerator to fully set. The biscotti will last for a couple of weeks in an airtight container at room temperature.
You also can melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl in the microwave: Microwave on high for 30 seconds, then for 1 minute longer, stirring at 10-second intervals until smooth.

teaspoon ground cayenne, or to taste (optional)
3
pounds boneless, skinless pork shoulder, cut into 2- to 3-inch chunks

Cooked basmati rice, for serving","552 user ratings","5 hours and 20 minutes","Step 1
Combine the onion, garlic, ginger, mustard seeds, cloves, peppercorns and 2½ teaspoons salt in a blender. Using the flat side of a chef’s knife, firmly press the cardamom pods so that they crack open. Put the seeds from each pod in the blender and discard the pods. (This yields about a heaping ¼ teaspoon of seeds.) Pour the vinegar into the blender. Blend, first on low until everything is combined, then on high, until the mixture is fully puréed and the whole spices are crushed, 30 seconds to 3 minutes depending on your blender. (You will see flecks of spices, but everything should be at least coarsely ground.)
Step 2
Pour the puréed mixture into a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker. Stir in the cinnamon stick, jaggery, cumin, turmeric, chile powder and cayenne (if using). Add the pork and stir to evenly combine. Cover and cook on high until the flavors have blended, the oniony taste is no longer sharp, and the pork is very tender, about 5 hours.
Step 3
Remove and discard the cinnamon stick. Taste and add more salt or sugar if you like, before serving with warmed rice. The sauce will be rich and a little soupy, great for spooning over rice. If you prefer a thicker sauce, remove the pork from the slow cooker with a slotted spoon and put it in a serving dish. Pour the sauce into a saucepan and simmer until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Pour the reduced sauce over the pork and serve with warm rice.
Jaggery, also called gur, is an unrefined brown cane sugar used in South Asia. It is often sold in a solid block or cone and can be grated. You can find it at any South Asian market, or from online retailers like Kalustyans.
Kashmiri chile powder is widely used in South Asian cooking. You can find the mild chile powder at any South Asian market, or from online retailers like Kalustyans. You can also substitute ½ teaspoon ground cayenne mixed with 2½ teaspoons sweet or hot (but not smoked) paprika.

¾
cup/150 grams turbinado sugar

⅓
cup/48 grams raw almonds, coarsely chopped

About 3 tablespoons/about 60 grams caramel topping, for finishing

Fleur de sel, for finishing","894 user ratings","45 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Center a rack in the oven and heat to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set the ring of a 9-inch springform pan (without its base) upside down on the prepared sheet. The ridge in the ring should be on top.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and baking soda; set aside.
Step 3
In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter, sugar and salt on medium-low speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Scrape in the almond butter and mix for 2 more minutes. Add about one-third of the flour mixture and beat on medium-low until blended. Pour in the egg and mix on low until incorporated. Add the rest of the dry ingredients and mix on low until they disappear into the dough. Scrape the dough into the center of the springform ring.
Step 4
Use a flexible or offset spatula or your fingers to spread the dough as evenly as you can. You don’t have to press it down aggressively, but you should try to get it relatively smooth. Scatter the chocolate over the surface and then scatter over the almonds.
Step 5
Bake the cookie for 22 to 25 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Transfer the baking sheet to a rack and immediately — and carefully — open and lift off the springform. Let the cookie cool to room temperature, then dot the surface with caramel sparingly or generously; if you’d like, you can drizzle the caramel. Sprinkle the top lightly with fleur de sel. Cut the cookie into 10 to 12 wedges, or go rogue and cut it into other shapes. Wrapped, the cookie will keep for about 4 days at room temperature.

teaspoon vanilla extract
¾
teaspoon peppermint extract, plus more if desired

Pinch kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)

Red gel food coloring (optional)

Shaved chocolate and sprinkles, for decorating (optional)","821 user ratings","1 hour, plus cooling","Step 1
Make the cake: Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Generously grease an 8-by-8-inch square or 9-inch round light-colored metal baking pan with oil.
Step 2
In a large bowl, combine the granulated sugar and eggs. Use a whisk or an electric mixer to beat the mixture until foamy and slightly lighter in texture and color, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, ½ cup oil, vanilla and salt, and whisk until combined and smooth, about 1 minute.
Step 3
Whisk in the cocoa powder until combined. Add the flour, baking powder and baking soda, and whisk until combined and no streaks of flour remain. Stir the espresso powder into the hot water, then add the mixture to the bowl. Whisk until incorporated.
Step 4
Pour the batter into the prepared pan and tap on the counter a few times to release any large air bubbles. Bake until puffed and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Let the cake cool in the pan set on a rack for about 45 minutes.
Step 5
While the cake bakes, clean the mixing bowl and make the frosting: Add the butter to the bowl and mix on medium-high with an electric mixer until smooth, stopping the mixer occasionally to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Turn the speed to low, and slowly add the confectioners’ sugar. Mix until the sugar is moistened, then add 2 teaspoons of the cream, the vanilla extract, ¾ teaspoon peppermint extract and salt. Turn the speed up to medium-high, and whip until smooth and fluffy, about 3 minutes, adding a bit more cream a teaspoon at a time, if necessary, to make a smooth and light frosting. Taste the frosting, and add a few more drops of peppermint extract if desired. The frosting can be kept at room temperature while the cake finishes baking and cooling.
Step 6
Top the cooled cake with an even layer of frosting, then use the tip of a toothpick to dot the frosting with a few small dots of gel food coloring, if using. Use a spoon or offset spatula to swirl the food coloring into the frosting to create candy cane-like stripes — just a few swipes will do the trick. If you mix it in too much, the frosting will turn pink. Top the cake with sprinkles and shaved chocolate, if desired. Store leftover cake loosely covered at room temperature for up to 3 days.

2
tablespoons olive oil
¼
cup/10 grams chives cut in ⅓-inch/1-centimeter pieces
1½
tablespoons lime juice (from 1 lime)","653 user ratings","About 1½ hours","Step 1
Heat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit/240 degrees Celsius (nonfan).
Step 2
Cut the butternut squash crosswise into ¾-inch/1½- to 2-centimeter-thick half moons. Transfer to a wide, large cast-iron skillet, skin side up, keeping the slices together in the shape of the butternut squash half. You might have to angle the pieces slightly so that they all fit. Place the shallots on either side of the squash.
Step 3
In a small bowl, combine oil, five-spice powder, cinnamon, ¾ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. Pour this all over the vegetables in the skillet, and use your hands to coat everything nicely, rearranging the squash pieces if necessary.
Step 4
Bake squash for 25 minutes, or until the squash is soft but not falling apart. Spoon out half the cooked shallots from the pan and set them aside, keeping them intact. Set squash aside to cool for 15 minutes, and turn the oven temperature down to 325 degrees Fahrenheit/170 degrees Celsius (nonfan).
Step 5
As the squash cools, prepare the custard: Add the stock and cream to a medium saucepan, and heat through on medium until steaming. In a separate large heatproof bowl, whisk together half the cheese, the yolks, garlic, cornstarch (cornflour), miso, ¼ teaspoon salt and a good grind of pepper. Slowly pour the scalding cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly, until incorporated and smooth.
Step 6
When ready, pour the warm custard into the butternut squash skillet, letting it pool all around the squash (avoid pouring it directly onto the squash). Sprinkle the remaining half of the cheese all over the custard, avoiding the top of the squash. Lastly, gently place the reserved shallots, cut-side up, on top of the custard and cheese. Carefully transfer to the oven and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until the custard is set with a very slight wobble.
Step 7
As custard cooks, prepare the topping: Add the sesame seeds to a small frying pan set over medium-high heat. Toast for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring often, until lightly browned. Add the Aleppo pepper, paprika, five-spice powder and a tiny pinch of salt, and turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the oil and leave to cook gently for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes before stirring in the chives and lime juice.
Step 8
When ready to serve, spoon the sesame topping all over the custard and serve warm.

Safflower, peanut or grapeseed oil, for frying","586 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
In the bowl of the food processor (or you can use a blender), add the rice cakes and pulse until you get 1¼ cups rice cake crumbs. Return ¼ cup crumbs to the food processor, reserving the remaining 1 cup for coating the cakes.
Step 2
Add shrimp, shallot, 4 tablespoons each of the cilantro and basil, and 2 tablespoons jalapeño to the crumbs. Add 2 teaspoons fish sauce, and a pinch each salt and pepper. Pulse until the mixture forms a coarse, chunky paste. (Be careful not to overprocess; if using a blender, scrape down the sides frequently.) Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate while you make the sauce (at least 15 minutes and up to 24 hours).
Step 3
In a small bowl, whisk together mayonnaise, remaining cilantro, basil, jalapeño and fish sauce. Zest the lime into the bowl, then cut the naked lime into wedges and squeeze in some juice. Salt to taste. Reserve extra lime wedges for serving.
Step 4
Spread remaining 1 cup rice cake crumbs out onto a plate or sheet pan. With wet hands to keep shrimp paste from sticking, form 2 tablespoons of shrimp mixture into a ½-inch-thick patty and put it on top of the crumbs. Repeat with remaining shrimp mixture, re-wetting your hands as necessary. Turn the patties over in the crumbs to coat both sides.
Step 5
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Fry patties in batches until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Serve shrimp cakes topped with more basil leaves, with chile-lime sauce for dunking and lime wedges on the side for squeezing.
Original, whole grain or brown rice cakes (either the thick or thin kind) all work well here. If you can’t find rice cakes, use 1¼ cups panko or cracker crumbs instead. The cakes won’t be quite as crisp, but they will still taste great.

Peel and quarter the potatoes, then cut into ¼-inch slices. Submerge the potatoes in a bowl of water and set aside.
Step 2
Heat the ghee in a heavy nonstick medium pot over medium-high. Add the garlic paste and ginger paste. Cook, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the smell of raw garlic and ginger dissipates, less than 1 minute. Add the onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to turn golden, 5 to 7 minutes.

(2-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly sliced

teaspoon hot chile powder
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
1
lime, cut into wedges, to serve
6
potato or Hawaiian buns, toasted, to serve
6
tablespoons butter, to serve","96 user ratings","1 hour 10 minutes","Step 1
Make the paneer: Heat the milk over medium in a large, heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to make sure the milk at the bottom of the pot doesn’t burn. Add the vinegar and use a wooden spoon to gently stir the milk. Continue to stir very, very gently for about 30 seconds, being careful not to break the curds as they form and lowering the heat if needed to prevent milk from bubbling over. Turn off the heat and stir very slowly for another minute. Slowly pour the curds and whey into a muslin-lined large colander set in the sink and let the whey drain out, about 10 minutes.
Step 2
Run cold tap water over the curds to rinse them of any lingering vinegar flavor. When all the water has drained away, 2 to 5 minutes, bring up the corners of the cloth and twist the cheese to make a ball, gently squeezing out the extra water and whey. Lift the cloth-wrapped paneer and transfer to an 8-inch loaf pan and, keeping it in the cloth, gently press it into the pan. Rest weights, such as canned tomatoes, on top, and after 10 minutes, gently press out and pour off excess liquid. Lift out and unwrap the paneer and set on a cutting board. It should hold its form, but still feel tender. While the paneer drains, prepare the masala and onions.
Step 3
Make the masala: Lightly toast the ajwain in a dry pan for 2 minutes, then put in a small food processor or large mortar and pestle to grind it roughly. Add the chiles, ginger, garlic, besan, garam masala, salt, chile powder and turmeric. Process or pound until you get a thick paste. Then add the yogurt and mix until smooth. If the marinade is too thick to easily coat the paneer, stir in a splash or two of water.
Step 4
Make the onion: Set a rack in the center of the oven and a rack under the broiler. Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Lay the onion slices on a parchment-lined sheet pan and coat with the oil. Slice the paneer 1-inch-thick, brush each slice all over with the marinade and lay the slices over the onion in a single layer. Bake for 10 minutes, or until the edges of the paneer and marinade have started to color. While the paneer bakes, mix the amchur, remaining ½ teaspoon chile and the salt. Remove the paneer from the oven.
Step 5
Heat the broiler, then broil the paneer for a minute or two to brown it a little further. Lightly dust the paneer with the amchur spice mix. Serve hot with the onion from the pan, lime wedges and toasted, buttered buns.

1
cup/110 grams fine semolina
½
teaspoon baking soda
½
cup toasted nuts, such as walnuts, pistachios or almonds, finely chopped","201 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Make the syrup: In a medium saucepan over high heat, combine sugar, cinnamon sticks and clove with 1⅓ cups water. Cut orange in half and place in saucepan, flesh down. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, until the sugar completely dissolves, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in honey. Set aside to cool completely, leaving the cinnamon, clove and orange in the syrup until ready to use.
Step 2
Heat the oven to 375 degrees and line 4 baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick liners, or lightly grease the pans with olive oil.
Step 3
Finely grate the zest of 1 orange into a large mixing bowl. Cut the orange in half and squeeze the juice into a measuring cup. If it doesn’t measure 1 cup (240 milliliters), squeeze in enough juice from the other orange. Add juice to the bowl with the zest, then mix in olive oil, sugar, brandy, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove and salt.
Step 4
In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together flour, semolina and baking soda. Gradually, fold in the flour mixture into the olive oil mixture. With a wooden spoon, mix until flour is just evenly incorporated.
Step 5
Using your hands, roll dough into 1½-inch ovals or egg-shapes, and place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Using the palm of your hand, lightly flatten dough. Bake until cookies are golden, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating baking sheets halfway through for even baking.
Step 6
Right before the cookies are done, remove the orange, cinnamon sticks and clove from the syrup. As soon as the cookies are out of the oven, and working in batches, dunk the hot cookies in the cool syrup, gently flipping them for about 10 seconds so they can absorb the syrup. Remove cookies from the syrup using a slotted spoon and arrange them on a tray or plate. Sprinkle the center of each cookie with a generous pinch of nuts, patting them lightly so they stick to cookies.
Step 7
Once cool, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. To prevent the cookies from sticking together, place sheets of wax or parchment paper between cookie layers.

2
teaspoons finely grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon)

Pinch of kosher salt
½
cup/120 milliliters extra-virgin olive oil","278 user ratings","10 minutes, plus cooling and 1 hour’s chilling","Step 1
Place the lemon juice, sugar, eggs, egg yolk, lemon zest and salt in a blender, and blend until smooth, about 30 seconds. With the motor still running, slowly pour in the oil until just combined.
Step 2
Fill a medium saucepan with about an inch of water and bring water to boil over high heat. Transfer lemon mixture to a metal mixing bowl that can nestle into top of the saucepan without touching the water. Reduce heat to medium-low and, using a potholder or towel to protect your hands, whisk constantly until the curd thickens and looks like mayonnaise, 6 to 10 minutes. Do not overcook. (If you have a double boiler, you can use that here instead of the pot and the bowl.)
Step 3
Remove bowl from the heat and inspect the curd. If you see hard bits of coagulated egg, strain the curd through a fine mesh sieve, pressing with a rubber spatula. (If it looks smooth, you can skip this step.) Transfer curd to a container and press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to create an airtight seal. Let the curd cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour.
To make the curd in the microwave, pour the lemon-olive oil mixture from the blender into a large glass bowl and cook in the microwave, on high power, in 1-minute intervals for 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk furiously between intervals, especially at the edges. Reduce power to 70 percent and continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes (stirring every minute), until the curd thickens and looks slightly puffed and spongy. Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface to create an airtight seal and let the curd cool to room temperature, then refrigerate.

3 to 4
tablespoons heavy whipping cream
¼
teaspoon almond extract
½
cup/70 grams finely chopped walnuts or almonds, to garnish","197 user ratings","1 hour 45 minutes, plus overnight chilling","Step 1
Make the dough: Combine flour, butter, sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Using a pastry blender or your fingertips, cut butter into flour, until the butter is the size of small peas.
Step 2
In a medium bowl, stir the yeast into the lukewarm milk, then add beaten egg yolks and almond extract. Pour yeast mixture into the flour mixture and stir lightly, handling as gently as pie crust, until the shaggy mass comes together in a sticky ball. Cover dough with plastic wrap and let rest in the refrigerator overnight.
Step 3
Make the filling: The day you plan to bake the butterhorns, combine the sugar, almonds, 2 tablespoons heavy cream, flour and almond extract in a separate medium bowl. It should resemble a wet sand with bits of nuts. If the filling is dry, add another tablespoon of cream. Set aside.
Step 4
Assemble the butterhorns: Lightly grease 3 baking sheets. Remove pastry dough from the refrigerator and divide dough into three equal rounds (about 13 ounces/365 grams each). Keep the other rounds refrigerated while you work with one piece. Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 16-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Cut each circle into 12 wedges, like you're cutting a pizza. Place 1 heaping teaspoon of filling just inside the curved edge of the wedge, leaving a ½-inch border.
Step 5
Fold the closest two corners over the filling to avoid leakage, then roll tightly all the way up to the point. (It should look like a little croissant.) Arrange pieces on a greased pan 2 inches apart, 12 butterhorns per pan, making sure that the point is tucked under to prevent it from unrolling while rising. Repeat with the remaining dough rounds. Let horns rise, uncovered, in a warm location until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
Step 6
About 30 minutes before you’re ready to bake, heat the oven to 365 degrees and make the frosting: Combine confectioners’ sugar, melted butter, heavy cream and almond extract in a large bowl, and mix until creamy and spreadable. Cover and set aside.
Step 7
Bake butterhorns for 12 to 15 minutes, until a light brown. Frost while still warm, and sprinkle with chopped nuts. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Start the stew: Set a large (5-quart) heavy pot over medium-high heat, add the oil and then the onion, celery and turnip, and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the chicken and cover with 5 cups of water, or enough to almost cover the chicken. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to maintain a simmer, and simmer for about 30 minutes, skimming any scum that rises. Cool, cover and refrigerate for at least a few hours, but ideally overnight. Scrape off and reserve 2 tablespoons chicken fat from the surface of the soup for the matzo ball mix. Freeze any remaining fat for another use. (You can substitute 2 tablespoons vegetable oil if you prefer.)
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the matzo ball mix (at least 3 hours before serving): Stir together the eggs, schmaltz or oil, stock, matzo meal, nutmeg, ginger and parsley in a large bowl until well mixed. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours, or overnight.

Heat the oil in a deep-sided sauté pan over medium-high to 350 degrees. Stick a wooden chopstick in the oil to see if it sizzles. If it does, it’s ready. Fry the saltines in 3 quick batches, adjusting the heat as needed, using a spider or a slotted spoon to swirl them around a little and to make sure they cook evenly to golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per batch.

3½
ounces Roquefort cheese, at room temperature

Black pepper

Flaky sea salt","146 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Step 2
Use a sharp knife to shave off the dark green tips of the frisée and escarole, then use your hands to tear off any remaining tough outer leaves, saving only the pale green and white, tender hearts for the salad. (Reserve the outer leaves for cooking greens — they’d be great for Thanksgiving stuffing!) Trim the radicchio, tearing off any bruised leaves and cutting off any root or stem.
Step 3
Once trimmed, separate all of the chicories into individual leaves, trimming more as needed to detach inner leaves. Leave the smaller leaves of all of the varieties whole, but tear or cut the larger leaves into generous bite-size pieces. Wash in cold water and dry in a salad spinner, then place in a very large bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
Step 4
Spread pecans out in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast 7 to 10 minutes until lightly golden in the center. Allow to cool to room temperature.
Step 5
To make the dressing, use a pestle to pound the anchovy and garlic in a mortar with a pinch of salt until the mixture is as smooth as toothpaste (or chop finely, then use the blade of a knife to smear across the cutting board until smooth). Whisk in mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, honey, oil, ¼ teaspoon salt, a few cracks of pepper and shallot until emulsified. Taste and adjust seasoning: The dressing should be pleasantly bright and tangy, and the anchovy shouldn’t be at all noticeable.
Step 6
To serve, quarter the pear, remove the core from each piece, and thinly slice. Add to the bowl of chicories. Crumble the pecans into the bowl in large pieces. Drizzle most of the dressing over the salad. Use your hands to toss gently to ensure the leaves are all coated evenly. Taste and add more dressing as needed. Transfer salad to a serving platter if desired, then crumble pecan-size pieces of cheese all throughout the salad, tossing as needed to distribute. Season generously with pepper and a bit of flaky salt. Serve immediately.

Prepare a steamer: Arrange an insert or basket (or a large colander, if you have neither) in a large pot, and add enough water to come just below the base of the steamer. Bring water to a boil over medium-high heat.
Step 2
Rinse potatoes well, then peel. Rinse again, then cut into 1-inch chunks. Spread evenly in the steamer, cover, reduce heat to medium and steam until the potatoes are very tender, 20 to 25 minutes. A fork should slide easily into a piece and break it without effort. Turn off the stove, carefully remove the steamer insert and drain the water from the pot. Pour the potatoes back into the pot and spread evenly.
Step 3
Let the potatoes stand until their surfaces are dry, about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the milk in a small saucepan over medium-high until steaming, then keep warm over low. Set the potatoes over low heat and mash thoroughly with a dinner fork. Add about one-quarter of the milk and mash until the milk is incorporated.
Step 4
Scatter the butter evenly over the potatoes and mash in until all traces of butter disappear. Add half of the remaining milk and mash to incorporate, then add the rest of the milk and gently whip until smooth, circling the fork as if beating eggs. If you don’t want your mashed potatoes so thick, beat in more milk. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, taste, and season more if you’d like.
Step 5
Serve immediately, keep warm over low heat for up to 1 hour, or transfer to airtight containers and refrigerate for up to 2 days. Mashed potatoes thicken as they cool, so they need cream to regain the right consistency. If kept warm, gently mash in heavy cream until smooth and loose again, adding more if you’d like. If cold, heat the cream in a large pot until steaming, then add the potatoes. Gently mash and whip, adding more cream as needed, until heated through and fluffy. Season to taste again before serving.

"Herby Fried Shallot and Bread Crumb Crunch","Bread,Rosemary,Sage,Shallot,Fall,Thanksgiving","Yield: About 3 cups","½
large loaf stale country bread, crusts removed and diced into 1-inch cubes (about 5 heaping cups)
2½
cups thinly sliced shallot rings (from about 7 shallots)
2
cups neutral oil, such as canola or safflower, for frying

Flaky sea salt
12
sage leaves (from 2 to 3 sprigs)
¼
packed cup fresh rosemary leaves (from 4 to 5 sprigs)
3
tablespoons finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves (from about ⅓ large bunch)
1
tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme (from 8 to 9 sprigs)","381 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
In a food processor, pulse the bread until no pieces larger than a pea remain. Set aside.
Step 2
Line 2 baking sheets with paper towels and set a fine-mesh strainer over a medium saucepan. Set aside.
Step 3
Combine shallots and oil in a second medium saucepan or a wok, and place over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until shallots begin to bubble, about 2 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low. With the shallots constantly bubbling — the constant bubble is key — continue frying. Stir regularly to ensure even cooking, until shallots turn pale golden brown, 24 to 28 minutes longer.
Step 4
Quickly and carefully pour the shallots and the oil into the prepared strainer, draining the oil into the first saucepan. (The shallots will continue to carry over to a deep golden brown as they cool and crisp up.) Carefully spread out the shallots to cool onto one of the prepared trays and season lightly with salt. Set aside.
Step 5
Reset the strainer over the now-empty pot and set aside. Place the saucepan with the strained oil over medium-high heat, and add a sage leaf to test the temperature. (Alternatively, use a thermometer to check that the oil is at 360 degrees.) When it sizzles, add the rest of the sage and the rosemary, and stir with a slotted spoon or spider. As soon as the bubbles subside, after 20 to 30 seconds, remove the herbs from the oil and spread them out onto the second baking sheet.
Step 6
Add the bread crumbs to the oil and stir. Cook, stirring constantly, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes, then quickly and carefully pour the bread crumbs and oil into the prepared strainer. Spread bread crumbs on the baking sheet beside the rosemary and sage. Season herbs and bread crumbs lightly with salt. Set aside and allow to cool.
Step 7
To assemble, in a large bowl, toss together shallots, bread crumbs, crumbled fried herbs, parsley and thyme, and ¾ teaspoon flaky salt. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed. Keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
To work ahead, fry shallots, rosemary, sage and bread crumbs up to 1 day in advance. Do not season with salt, and wrap separately once completely cooled in airtight containers. Just before using, combine the ingredients, and add parsley, thyme and salt.
You can change up the herb combinations, or add dried chilies or nuts depending on the time of year. This recipe is endlessly adaptable and will add excitement and crunch to all kinds of dishes, whether soups or pasta, eggs or braises.

medium shallots, finely diced
⅓
cup red wine vinegar
½
cup very finely chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves (from about 1 large bunch)
¾
cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more if needed

Fine sea salt
2
cups neutral oil, such as canola or safflower, for frying
¾
cup loosely packed sage leaves (from about 1 large bunch)","387 user ratings","About 20 minutes","Step 1
Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set aside.
Step 2
In a small bowl, combine the shallots and vinegar, and set aside for 15 minutes to soften. In a medium bowl, combine parsley, olive oil and a generous pinch of salt. Set aside.
Step 3
Pour the neutral oil into a medium saucepan and set over medium-high heat. After 2 minutes, add a sage leaf to test the temperature. (The oil should be around 360 degrees.) When the sage leaf sizzles, add the rest of the sage and stir with a slotted spoon or spider. As soon as the bubbles subside, after about 20 seconds, remove the herbs from the oil and spread them out onto the prepared baking sheet. Season lightly with salt. The sage will get crisp as it cools.
Step 4
Just before serving, use a slotted spoon to add the shallots (but not the vinegar, yet) to the parsley oil. Stir, taste and add salt and vinegar as needed to achieve a nice tang. Crumble and stir the sage into the salsa. The final sauce should be loose enough to drizzle from a spoon, so adjust with a little more oil if needed, then taste and adjust with salt and vinegar one last time before serving. Cover and refrigerate leftovers for up to 3 days. It makes an excellent accompaniment for Thanksgiving dishes, as well as any other roasted meats, vegetables or grilled fish.
This salsa is best assembled right before serving, but the shallots can be macerated up to 4 hours in advance, and the sage can be fried up to 1 day ahead of time as long as it is allowed to cool and then wrapped in an airtight container and held at room temperature to keep it crisp.
If you’re also planning on making the Herby Fried Shallot and Bread Crumb Crunch, you can fry the sage for both recipes at the same time to conserve oil.

"Caramel Apple Pudding","Parfaits And Trifles,Apple,Vanilla Wafer,Whipped Cream,Dessert,Thanksgiving","Yield: 6 to 8 servings","For the Caramel Apples
4
tablespoons unsalted butter

large crisp sweet-tart apples (1 pound), such as Fuji or Pink Lady, unpeeled and finely chopped (see Tip)
¼
cup lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)
¼
packed cup dark brown sugar
1
teaspoon ground cinnamon
½
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
For the Whipped Cream
2
cups very cold heavy whipping cream
1
packed tablespoon dark brown sugar
1
teaspoon ground cinnamon
½
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
For Assembly
1
(11-ounce) box vanilla wafers","535 user ratings","35 minutes, plus chilling","Step 1
Make the caramel apples: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the apples, lemon juice, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples are tender and the liquid is reduced but saucy with the consistency of chunky applesauce, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside to cool slightly.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the whipped cream: In a large bowl, using a large whisk or an electric mixer, whisk the cream, brown sugar, cinnamon and salt until soft peaks form. (When you lift the whisk out of the bowl and turn it whisk-side up, a peak of cream should flop over onto itself.) Don’t overbeat; you’re looking for a soft-set whipped cream that drapes rather than plops.
Step 3
Assemble the pudding: In a medium bowl or other serving vessel (preferably clear), arrange one-third of the vanilla wafers at the bottom, top with half of the caramel apples, then spread with half of the whipped cream. Repeat these layers once more and end with a final sprinkle of crushed vanilla wafers on top. (If you want crunch, save this final sprinkle for right before serving.) Cover and refrigerate until the cookies are soft, about 8 hours and up to 24 hours.
Though you could finely chop the apples by hand, cutting them into chunks and blitzing them in a food processor is infinitely quicker and highly recommended here.

"Mashed Sweet Potatoes With Roasted Garlic","","Yield: 4 to 6 servings","1
large head of garlic
1
tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Salt and black pepper
2
pounds sweet potatoes (see Tip)
½
cup heavy cream
4
tablespoons unsalted butter","303 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Heat oven to 350 degrees. Turn the garlic head on its side and carefully cut off the very top end to expose the cloves. (Discard the top.) Place the head of garlic on a sheet of foil, cut side up, and drizzle with the oil and season with salt and pepper. Wrap tightly and place on a sheet pan. Wrap each sweet potato individually in foil and place on the pan alongside the garlic.
Step 2
Bake until the sweet potatoes are tender and the garlic is soft, fragrant and slightly caramelized, about 1 hour. Set aside, still wrapped, to cool slightly.
Step 3
Meanwhile, heat the cream and butter in the microwave in 30-second intervals, checking after each, until the butter is melted, about 1 minute. (Alternatively, you can heat the cream and butter in a small saucepan over medium until the butter is melted.)
Step 4
Unwrap the sweet potatoes and peel them, discarding the skin and adding the flesh to a large bowl. Squeeze the garlic head, cut side down, into the bowl to release the roasted cloves. Pour in the hot cream and butter. Using a whisk or fork, break up the potatoes and garlic and vigorously stir until smooth and fluffy, at least 30 seconds. Taste for seasoning, adjusting with salt and pepper as needed. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve warm. (To make ahead, transfer to a buttered casserole dish or cake pan, cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours, until ready to eat. Bake in a 350-degree oven or microwave until heated through, about 15 minutes. On Thanksgiving, you should reheat this when the turkey is out of the oven and resting.)
There are many varieties of sweet potatoes available now, but what you want here are just the regular brown-skinned, orange-fleshed ones (varieties of which include jewel, Covington and Beauregard). Don’t use red-skinned or white-fleshed sweet potatoes, which cook differently.

1
cup/230 milliliters buttermilk, preferably full-fat
¼
cup/56 grams unsalted butter, melted

Whipped heavy cream for serving","849 user ratings","1 hour, plus at least 50 minutes’ chilling","Step 1
Prepare the pie crust: Generously butter a 10-inch round, fluted tart pan. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar, salt, black pepper and lemon zest. Working quickly, rub the cold butter into the dry mixture using your fingers or a pastry cutter. Cut the butter into the flour until the pieces are the size of small pebbles. (Alternatively, use a food processor to pulse the dry ingredients with the butter.) Add the egg yolks and the cold water. Using your hands, combine just until the dough comes together in clumps. Gather dough into a ball; flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic and chill at least 30 minutes.
Step 2
Heat oven to 375 degrees. Roll out chilled dough between two sheets of parchment or on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch round. Using the rolling pin, transfer dough into the prepared tart pan. Press the dough into the fluted sides and trim any overhang to ¼ inch above the pan. Chill the dough again for at least 20 minutes.
Step 3
Line the pie dough with parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the crust is lightly browned along the edges and beginning to firm up, about 18 minutes. Remove the pie weights and parchment and bake for another 5 minutes to lightly brown the edges. Press down the surface with the back of a spoon if the crust bubbles. Allow the crust to cool completely before filling. Adjust the oven temperature to 350 degrees.
Step 4
As the crust cools, prepare the filling: Whisk together eggs, yolks, sugar, cornmeal, lemon juice and zest and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in buttermilk and the melted butter.
Step 5
Place the tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet and carefully pour the filling into the cooled pie shell. Bake until the filling is set and jiggles slowly when the tart pan is moved back and forth, about 35 to 40 minutes. Cool pie completely before slicing. Top with a dusting of powdered sugar and serve at room temperature or cold, with some whipped heavy cream on the side.

For the Yogurt
2
Persian or other mini cucumbers

Salt
1½
cups plain Greek yogurt
1
garlic clove, crushed
½
teaspoon lemon juice","161 user ratings","1¼ hours","Step 1
Make the rice: Mix together allspice, cinnamon, black pepper and nutmeg and set aside. Rinse rice in a colander until the water runs almost clear, then soak in cold water for 15 minutes. Drain and let stand for 15 minutes.
Step 2
While rice soaks and drains, heat butter and olive oil in a large Dutch oven or nonstick pot over medium-high. Once the butter starts to sizzle, add half of the spice mixture and fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Add meat and cook, breaking the meat up finely with a wooden spoon, until any released water evaporates and the meat is nicely browned, 10 to 15 minutes. (It is important for the meat to be in small even-size pieces.)
Step 3
Add drained rice to the pot, along with remaining spices, and stir to combine and coat with the oil. Pour in the stock and bring to a boil. Taste for seasoning: the stock should be saltier than you would like your finished dish to be, so add more salt to your liking, but do so generously.
Step 4
Once the mixture boils, lower the heat to maintain a simmer, cover the pot and cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated but the rice is still easy to stir with a spoon and not sticking to the bottom, 8 to 12 minutes. Give the rice a final mix, turn off the heat, then wrap a clean tea towel or paper towels around the lid and cover again. (The towel will absorb excess moisture.) Let sit to steam in the residual heat for 20 minutes.
Step 5
While the rice cooks, prepare the topping: Place a small skillet over medium-high and pour in enough oil to thinly coat the bottom (1 to 2 tablespoons). Add pine nuts and stir to coat evenly with the oil. Reduce heat to heat to low and continue to stir until nuts are a light golden color, about 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain nuts on a plate lined with paper towels. Repeat with slivered almonds.
Step 6
While the rice rests, make the yogurt: Coarsely grate the cucumber and place in a colander in the sink. Sprinkle with salt, mix and set aside for 10 minutes to allow juices to drain. Give the cucumbers one final mix, pressing on them with the back of a spoon to ensure any excess liquid drains. Transfer to a bowl and add the yogurt, garlic and lemon juice and season with salt. Whisk until well combined, taste and add more salt if you’d like.
Step 7
Fluff rice with a large fork, transfer to a serving platter and top with toasted nuts. Serve, passing the yogurt around for each person to place a dollop over their rice.
Hashweh is perfectly delicious with either ground beef, lamb or a combination. But if you have the time, the texture of hand diced meat is preferable. Any cut of meat will do since it will be chopped very finely: beef flank, brisket, sirloin, even stewing cuts as well as leg of lamb. Chop it small — no larger than a dry chickpea. The easiest way to do this is to freeze your meat until almost fully frozen but still sliceable with a knife, then you can easily cut through it like you would a root vegetable.

Heavy cream, milk or a beaten egg, for glazing (optional)

Demerara sugar, for glazing (optional)","1476 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Melt butter in a large skillet set over medium-high heat and add apples to the pan. Stir to coat with butter and cook, stirring occasionally, until the butter is evenly distributed, about 1 minute.
Step 2
In a small bowl, whisk together sugars, spices and salt. Sprinkle over the apples and toss to combine.
Step 3
Lower heat to medium and cook until apples have softened completely but still hold their shape, about 17 to 25 minutes. (Some varieties cook more quickly than others.)
Step 4
Sprinkle cornstarch evenly over the apples and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the apple mixture comes to a simmer and thickens slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove pan from heat, and stir in lemon juice and zest. Allow apples to cool completely (spreading them onto a rimmed baking sheet speeds this up). Apples can be prepared up to 24 hours ahead and refrigerated.
Step 5
On a lightly floured surface, roll half of the pie dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer dough to a 9- or 10-inch metal pie plate, trimming it to leave a ½-inch overhang. Place crust in the freezer for 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.
Step 6
When ready to bake, place a rimmed baking sheet on the middle oven rack and heat oven to 425 degrees.
Step 7
Roll out the remaining dough on a lightly floured surface to a 10- to 11-inch circle. Remove pie crust from freezer and add the cooled filling in an even layer. Cover apples with remaining dough. Press the edges together, trim the excess dough, and crimp the edges with your fingers or a press down with the tines of a fork. (Using a fork might be easier if the bottom crust is too cold to crimp.) Brush the top of the pie with cream, milk or some beaten egg, then sprinkle lightly with sugar if you like. Using a sharp knife, cut some steam vents in the top of the crust.
Step 8
Place pie on the hot sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 375 degrees and bake for another 30 to 40 minutes, until the filling bubbles in the steam vents, and the crust is golden brown. Transfer pie to a wire cooling rack and allow to cool for at least 2 hours before serving. The pie can be baked up to 24 hours ahead of serving; do not refrigerate before serving.
Honeycrisp, Golden Delicious and Granny Smith are good options, though you might want to increase the lemon juice if your apples are on the sweet side.

Heat oven to 400 degrees. Place racks at middle lower and middle upper positions. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.
Step 2
In a small bowl, combine raisins and wine. Set aside to soak.
Step 3
In a large bowl, gently toss brussels sprouts with 4 tablespoons oil to coat. Season with ½ teaspoon salt. Spread out sprouts onto prepared baking sheets, and roast until tender throughout and golden brown on the outside, 28 to 32 minutes. Halfway through cooking, rotate pans, switch their positions, and use a thin metal spatula to turn the sprouts so that they brown evenly on both sides.
Step 4
In the meantime, set a 12-inch nonreactive skillet over medium-high heat and add 3 tablespoons oil. When it shimmers, add onions, a generous pinch of salt and the saffron, crushing the threads with your fingers as you add them. Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are tender and just beginning to brown, 16 to 18 minutes.

Spread the pine nuts onto a small baking sheet and toast in the oven until lightly golden, 3 to 4 minutes. (Set a timer to prevent burning!)
Step 6
When the onions are done, add raisins and wine, pine nuts, vinegar, sugar, a few cracks of pepper, parsley, a generous pinch of salt and remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Bring to a simmer and remove from heat. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed: This mixture should be sweet, bright and perk up your palate.

tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger
6
garlic cloves, finely grated
1
teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste
4
cups loosely packed cilantro leaves and tender stems (from about 2 large bunches)","227 user ratings","About 15 minutes","Step 1
Place cumin in a small skillet and set over medium-high heat. Toast for 2 to 3 minutes, or until seeds just begin to change color and emit a faint aroma. Immediately dump seeds into a spice grinder or mortar, and grind to a powder.
Step 2
Place dates, lime juice, jalapeños, ginger, garlic, salt and cumin into the bowl of a food processor and pulse, stopping periodically to scrape the sides with a rubber spatula as needed. Try to get this mixture as uniformly puréed as possible, though a little texture is fine.
Step 3
Add the cilantro and continue to pulse to break it down. Then, add as little water as possible — about a tablespoon — to get the blades moving and turn the mixture into the sauce. Continue scraping the sides and pulsing until no large bits of stem or leaf remain and the sauce is a lovely, almost-but-not-quite-smooth texture. Taste, and add lime juice and salt as needed. Cover and refrigerate until serving. This sauce will keep for up to 5 days in the fridge.
This sauce can be made up to 1 day in advance.

"Sweet Potato Biscuits","Biscuit,Buttermilk,Honey,Scallion,Sweet Potato,Side Dish,Fall,Kwanzaa,Thanksgiving","Yield: 12 biscuits","For the Biscuits
1
medium sweet potato (11 to 14 ounces), scrubbed
4
cups/526 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling the dough
1
tablespoon granulated sugar
2
teaspoons kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
2½
teaspoons baking powder
¼
teaspoon baking soda
¾
cup/170 grams cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes
2
scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced (⅓ cup)
1¼
cups buttermilk
For the Spiced Honey Butter (optional)
½
cup/114 grams unsalted butter, room temperature
¼
teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼
teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg
¼
teaspoon ground black pepper
½
teaspoon kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)
2
tablespoons honey","472 user ratings","2 hours 10 minutes","Step 1
Make the biscuits: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Wrap the sweet potato tightly in foil and bake until tender enough for a knife to go in with no resistance, 45 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely. Scoop out 6 ounces/175 grams of cooked sweet potato flesh (about ¾ cup). (The sweet potato can be baked in advance and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days.) Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.
Step 2
In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda. Working quickly, rub or cut the cold butter into the dry mixture using your fingers or a pastry cutter until the butter pieces are the size of peas. (Alternatively, use a food processor and pulse the dry ingredients with the butter to cut in the butter.)
Step 3
Add the scallions and toss to coat with the flour mixture. Cut the cooked sweet potato into ½-inch chunks and drop into the bowl, tossing gently to coat with flour so that the pieces stay separated. Make a well in the center and pour in the buttermilk. Use a wooden spoon to stir until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface.
Step 4
Roll the dough into an 11-by-7-inch rectangle. Use a floured spatula to lift one end of the dough and fold over one-third of the rectangle. Fold the other end over the top as if folding a letter. You should end up with a rectangular piece of folded dough. Lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll again into a 12-by-6-inch rectangle. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 (2-by-3-inch) rectangles. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet, spacing about 1 ½ inches apart.
Step 5
Bake until biscuits are golden brown and cooked through, rotating the pan about halfway through, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer the biscuits to a wire rack to cool slightly before serving warm.
Step 6
While the biscuits bake, make the honey butter, if you like: In a small bowl, combine the butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper and salt. Add the honey, and use a fork to cut the ingredients into the butter until incorporated and smooth. Transfer to a small bowl and serve with the warm biscuits. The butter can be covered and refrigerated for up to 7 days. Bring to room temperature before serving.

"Maple-Honey Pecan Pie","Freezer Friendly,Honey,Make Ahead,Maple Syrup,Pecan,Pecan Pie,Pie Dough,Plan Ahead,Dessert,Thanksgiving","Yield: 8 servings","
All-purpose flour, for rolling out the dough

Dough for a 9-inch single crust pie
½
cup/115 grams unsalted butter
¼
cup/85 grams maple syrup
¼
cup/85 grams honey
½
cup/110 grams light brown sugar
½
cup/75 grams maple sugar or use more light brown sugar
3
large eggs, at room temperature
1
tablespoon bourbon (optional)
1
teaspoon vanilla extract
¾
teaspoon kosher salt
1½
cups/180 grams pecan halves

Flaky sea salt, such as Maldon (optional)","1928 user ratings","1½ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a 12-inch circle, and transfer to a 9-inch metal pie plate. Fold over any excess dough, crimping the edges. Transfer crust to the freezer for 30 minutes or up to 24 hours.
Step 2
When ready to bake, place a rimmed baking sheet on the middle oven rack and heat oven to 425 degrees.
Step 3
Heat a small saucepan and melt the butter over medium heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the foam subsides, the milk solids turn golden brown and the butter smells nutty and toasty, about 5 minutes. Add maple syrup to the pan and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and reduces slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and whisk honey into the warm syrup mixture. Let cool at least 10 minutes.
Step 4
While the syrup mixture cools, combine sugars, eggs, bourbon (if using), vanilla and salt in a large mixing bowl. Gradually pour syrup mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly, then use a rubber spatula to scrape in all the brown bits at the bottom of the pot.
Step 5
Remove pie crust from freezer and place pecans along the bottom of the crust. Carefully pour the filling over the pecans. Place pie plate on the hot sheet pan and bake for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees and continue to bake for another 35 to 45 minutes, until the center of the pie has puffed up and turned golden brown.
Step 6
Transfer pie to a wire cooling rack, sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if you like, and allow to cool for at least 2 hours before serving. Serve warm or at room temperature.
If using a glass pie plate, line chilled crust with foil or parchment paper and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes at 400 degrees; remove foil and weights and bake until pale golden, 5 minutes more. Cool on rack until needed.

"Salt-and-Pepper Roast Turkey Breast","Poultry,Butter,Lemon,Turkey Breast,Main Course,Thanksgiving","Yield: 6 to 8 servings","½
cup unsalted butter, very soft

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1
whole (6- to 8-pound) bone-in turkey breast (see Tip)
4
lemons, quartered, for garnish","574 user ratings","2 hours, plus overnight thawing and 2 hours’ resting","Step 1
Keep the butter nearby. Place about ¼ cup kosher salt in a small bowl and keep nearby as well, along with a black-pepper grinder. Transfer the turkey breast to a large sheet pan and thoroughly dry all over with a paper towel; get it as bone-dry as you can.
Step 2
Using your hands, very liberally rub the butter all over the turkey breast. (If the butter is difficult to spread, soften it further in the microwave in 10-second intervals.) Make sure to slather the butter on the underside and bones in addition to the entire surface of the skin. Wipe your hands with a towel.
Step 3
Generously season the turkey all over with salt, especially inside the cavity. You don’t have to be precise here, but do go heavy on the salt — the turkey can take it. (In general, you should account for about 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt or ¾ teaspoon Morton coarse kosher salt per pound.) Next, generously grind black pepper all over the turkey; again, no need to measure this. Let the turkey breast sit so the seasoning can penetrate the meat and allow the bird to come to room temperature, about 1 hour.
Step 4
Meanwhile, position a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat oven to 350 degrees. Place the turkey breast in the oven, then with the oven door still open, carefully pour 1 cup water into the sheet pan with the turkey. Close the oven door and roast until the turkey’s internal temperature reaches 150 degrees, 13 to 15 minutes per pound. (To read the temperature, insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of one of the breasts, making sure to avoid the bone, which will give you an inaccurate reading.) Very carefully rotate the pan halfway through roasting and add another cup of water if the pan looks dry. When done roasting (1½ to 2 hours), the skin should be golden brown and crispy.
Step 5
Let the turkey breast rest in its pan, uncovered, until cool enough to handle, at least 30 minutes and up to 1 hour. Transfer to a cutting board. Cut along one side of the breastbone with a sharp knife, then the other, cutting each breast off the bone, and keeping the skin intact. Thickly slice each breast crosswise and serve on a large platter scattered with the lemon quarters. Taste the pan juices and, if they’re a little salty, stir in a little hot water. If they need more seasoning, stir in salt and pepper. Spoon the pan juices over and around the sliced turkey.
If your turkey breast is frozen (most are), thaw it in the refrigerator a day or two before you plan to roast it. You can also thaw a frozen turkey breast by letting it sit — still in its packaging — in a large bucket or pot filled with cold tap water, about 30 minutes per pound. Every hour, be sure to turn the breast and change the water.

"Ultimate Pumpkin Pie","Butternut Squash,Food Processor,Ground Cinnamon,Ground Ginger,Nutmeg,Pumpkin Pie,Dessert,Fall,Thanksgiving","Yield: 8 servings","2
pounds butternut squash (1 small squash), peeled, seeded and cut into 1½-inch chunks (about 3 cups), see Tip
1
cup/240 milliliters heavy cream
2
tablespoons granulated sugar
2
tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces

All-purpose flour, for rolling out the dough

½
teaspoon grated nutmeg
⅛
teaspoon ground allspice or pinch of ground cloves
1
tablespoon bourbon or dark rum, or use 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
½
teaspoon fine sea salt","2435 user ratings","About 2 hours, plus 1½ hours’ chilling","Step 1
Place two racks in the oven: one in the lower third and one in the upper third. Place a rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack and heat oven to 400 degrees.
Step 2
Line another rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and spread butternut squash on it. Drizzle squash with 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream, sprinkle with granulated sugar and dot the top with butter. Roast on the upper rack, stirring once or twice, until squash is very tender, 40 to 50 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, on a lightly floured surface, roll pie dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer to a 9-inch metal pie pan. Fold over any excess dough, crimping the edges. Transfer to the freezer for at least 30 minutes and up to 24 hours. (This helps the crust hold its shape so the edges don’t slump.)
Step 4
When the squash is soft, transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool for at least 10 minutes (and up to a few hours). Raise the oven temperature to 425 degrees.
Step 5
In a food processor or blender, purée the squash with the remaining cream until smooth. Add eggs, brown sugar, spices, bourbon and salt, and pulse to combine. The mixture should be very smooth.
Step 6
Pour mixture into the chilled pie shell. Carefully transfer pie to the hot baking sheet on the bottom rack. Bake for 10 minutes, then lower the oven temperature to 300 and continue to bake until the crust is golden and the center jiggles just slightly when shaken, 35 to 45 minutes longer. Transfer pie to a wire cooling rack and allow to cool completely before serving.
If you are buying peeled, cubed squash, you will need 1¼ pounds. If you want to substitute canned pumpkin, you will need 1½ cups (the remaining purée in the can is great stirred into oatmeal).

The night before serving, spread the bread pieces on a sheet pan and let sit on the counter to dry out. Alternatively, you can bake them at 250 degrees until completely dried out and no longer soft, 20 to 30 minutes.
Step 2
When ready to make the stuffing, transfer the bread to a large bowl. Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9-by-13-inch or 8-by-11-inch baking dish with softened butter.
Step 3
Melt the 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high and add the onion. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent and slightly browned at the edges, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the oregano and tomato paste and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the stock and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.
Step 4
In a medium bowl, beat the egg with a fork, then beat in the milk. Pour the stock mixture and milk mixture over the bread and toss with two spoons until evenly coated. Add 1 cup mozzarella, and toss again until well combined. Let sit until the bread fully absorbs the liquid, about 5 minutes.
Step 5
Transfer the stuffing and any accumulated liquid to the greased baking dish, spread out evenly and top with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. (To make ahead, you can stop at this stage, cover the dish and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.)
Step 6
Bake, uncovered, until heated through and the cheese is melted, 15 to 25 minutes. (You may need to add a few minutes to the bake time if the stuffing has been refrigerated.) Sprinkle a pinch of oregano over the top and serve immediately.

cup chopped dill or 2 teaspoons dried dill
½
cup chopped parsley","612 user ratings","30 to 35 minutes","Step 1
Turn on a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker and select the sauté setting (on the more, or hot, setting, if you have it). Add the vegetable oil, then half of the mushrooms. Season with salt, and brown for about 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Remove the first batch of mushrooms and place on a plate. Add a little more oil if the pot is dry, and brown the second batch the same way, seasoning with salt and transferring the mushrooms to the plate when done.
Step 2
Add the butter to the pot, then the onion. Season with salt and cook for 2 minutes, stirring, until the onion just begins to soften. Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute more, until the garlic is fragrant. Add the sweet and smoked paprikas; stir well to combine the spices with the onion.

Warm the oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. Add half the mushrooms, season with salt, and brown for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice. Meanwhile, spread the potatoes on a plate or a shallow bowl and microwave for 3 to 5 minutes; they should be about halfway cooked, not fully.

⅛
teaspoon ground green cardamom
¼
cup shelled salted pistachios, chopped
2
tablespoons golden raisins, chopped
2
tablespoons dried tart cherries, chopped
¼
cup chopped parsley, plus more for garnish","740 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high. Make a lengthwise cut into each onion from the top to root end, slicing only halfway through to the middle of the onion. (This will make it easier to separate the layers.) Reduce heat to medium-high and simmer briskly until the onions are softened through the middle and the layers separate easily, about 25 minutes. Transfer onions to a cutting board and let cool.
Step 2
Meanwhile, heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread almonds on a baking sheet and toast until lightly golden, 6 to 7 minutes; transfer to a plate to cool. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees.
Step 3
In a small bowl, combine saffron and lemon juice, and let sit.
Step 4
Separate the onion layers until just the centers remain. (You may have to trim the root ends a bit more if the layers don’t completely separate.) Cut the 2 largest outer layers from each onion in half for 12 equal pieces, then count out more of the inner layers for a total of 20 to 24 stuffed onions. (The number will vary depending on the size of onions.) Finely chop the remaining onion centers and any remaining onion layers to make 1 cup; a little less or more is OK.
Step 5
Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a high-sided, 12-inch ovenproof skillet with a lid over medium. Add chopped onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 3 minutes. Stir in rice and 2 tablespoons of the melted butter, and stir until evenly coated. Stir in 1 teaspoon salt, the pepper, saffron-lemon juice, cinnamon stick, cumin, cardamom and 1 cup of water. Bring to a boil over high, then cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook until the liquid is just absorbed, about 3 minutes (rice will still be undercooked). Stir in toasted almonds, pistachios, raisins, cherries and parsley.
Step 6
Spoon 2 tablespoons of the rice mixture in the center of each onion layer so that the onion loosely covers the filling. (Rice will expand; bundles should be partly open.) Scrape out and discard any remaining rice (or reserve for future use) and clean out the skillet.
Step 7
Coat the bottom of the skillet with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and arrange onions seam side up in a single layer. Add 1 cup of water to the pan, season onions with salt and pepper, and drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Bring to a boil over high, cover tightly and transfer to the oven to bake until all the liquid has been absorbed, rice is cooked through and onions are tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.
Step 8
Garnish with parsley and drizzle with oil. Serve warm.
