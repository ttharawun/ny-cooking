pound root vegetables (any mix of carrots, parsnips and potatoes), cut into 1½-inch pieces
4
tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces
2
large scallions, thinly sliced crosswise","0 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
In a large bowl, stir together the olive oil, vinegar, soy sauce, ground ginger, onion powder, 4 tablespoons honey, 2 teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add the chicken and turn to coat. If you have the time, cover and refrigerate for 1 to 24 hours.
Step 2
Heat the oven to 425 degrees.
Step 3
Pour the chicken and all of its marinade into a 13-by-9-inch baking pan (preferably metal). Add the root vegetables and toss to coat in the marinade, then spread the chicken and vegetables in a snug but single layer. Roast for 30 minutes.
Step 4
Remove the pan from the oven and turn up the heat to 450 degrees. Turn the chicken and vegetables in the pan juices, then drizzle all over with the remaining 2 tablespoons honey and top with the butter. Continue roasting until the pan sauce is sticky and the chicken and vegetables are browned, 10 to 15 minutes.
Step 5
To serve, tilt the pan to collect the sauce in one corner, then spoon it over the chicken and vegetables to make them glossy. Scatter over the scallions and serve directly from the pan.

"Pineapple Ham","Meat,Dark Brown Sugar,Ham,Pineapple,Pineapple Juice,Dinner,Main Course,Easter","Yield: 12 servings","1
bone-in, fully cooked unsliced half ham (7½ to 10 pounds)
2
cups canned pineapple juice
1
pineapple (see Tip)
6
packed tablespoons dark brown sugar
6
tablespoons lemon juice (from 2 lemons)
1½
tablespoons Dijon mustard

Freshly ground black pepper or ground cloves","41 user ratings","3½ hours","Step 1
Position a rack near the bottom of the oven and heat the oven to 325 degrees. Using a sharp paring knife, make parallel cuts across the surface of the ham, about a ½-inch deep and 1 inch apart, then repeat in the opposite direction to create a diamond pattern.
Step 2
Place the ham in a large roasting pan, cut side down, and pour over the pineapple juice. Cover the ham with parchment, then cover the pan tightly with foil. Bake until the ham is heated through, 2 to 2½ hours. The internal temperature should reach 135 degrees, which takes about 15 minutes per pound.
Step 3
While the ham cooks, trim the top and bottom off the pineapple, then cut off the peel. Halve the pineapple from top to bottom, then slice into ½-inch-thick half moons. Using a small circular cookie cutter or small knife, cut out and discard the core.
Step 4
Carefully remove the ham from the oven and raise the temperature to 425 degrees.
Step 5
Uncover the ham and ladle out 2 cups of the liquid into a large skillet. Add the brown sugar, lemon juice, mustard and a few generous grinds of black pepper or a pinch of cloves to the skillet and bring to a boil over high heat to make the glaze. Cook, whisking occasionally, until the glaze is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 6
Scatter the pineapple around the pan. Using a spoon or a brush, apply half of the glaze all over the surface of the ham and some over the pineapple slices. Bake, uncovered, until the glaze is bronzed, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer the ham to a cutting board to rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving with the pineapple and extra glaze.
In some markets, you can buy fresh pineapple already peeled, cored and sliced in the refrigerated produce section. You can use that as a shortcut here or prepare a pineapple as detailed in step 3.

"Siu Yuk (Crispy Pork Belly)","Chinese,Meat,Five Spice Powder,Fresh Ginger,Make Ahead,Pork Belly,Project,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 4 servings","1
(2-pound) slab skin-on pork belly
1
tablespoon Shaoxing wine
2
scallions, tied into a knot
1
(2-inch) piece fresh ginger, unpeeled and sliced
1
dried star anise (optional)
1
teaspoon whole black peppercorns (optional)
½
tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons fine sea salt
½
teaspoon five-spice powder
¼
teaspoon ground white pepper
¼
teaspoon ground ginger (optional)
½
teaspoon white vinegar

English mustard, to taste","6 user ratings","2 hours, plus 24 hours’ resting and drying","Step 1
In a large pot, combine the pork belly with enough water to cover it by 1 inch. Add the Shaoxing wine, scallions, ginger, star anise (if using) and whole black peppercorns (if using); bring the water to a rolling boil over high heat. Cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer until the meat is soft and tender, about 1 hour. Poke the meat (not the skin) with a chopstick; the juices should run clear. Take it out of the pot and let it cool down.
Step 2
In a small bowl, combine ½ tablespoon of the fine sea salt with the five-spice powder, white pepper and ground ginger (if using). When the pork belly is cool enough to handle, flip the pork belly over so that the skin faces down. Rub the seasoning all over the flesh side, leaving the skin unseasoned.
Step 3
Make a tray out of aluminum foil, just large enough to hold the pork belly, and place the pork belly inside, skin side up, making sure all four sides of the meat are completely covered with the foil. Only the skin of the pork belly should be exposed. WIth a meat tenderizer tool or a sharp fork, poke multiple shallow holes all over the skin of the pork, making sure not to puncture too deeply into the meat below. Brush the skin with the white vinegar. Sprinkle the remaining 2 teaspoons of the salt on top.
Step 4
Let the pork rest in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least 18 hours and up to 24 hours. This will dry out the skin even further.
Step 5
Take the pork belly out and let it come to room temperature, about 1 hour. The skin needs to be completely dry and leathery. If it’s not, blot it gently with a paper towel and blow it dry with a hair dryer.
Step 6
Heat the broiler to its highest setting. If you don’t have a broiler, heat the oven to 450 degrees, preferably with the oven fan on.
Step 7
Place the pork belly still nestled in its aluminum foil tray (this ensures that the meat doesn’t overcook) on a wire rack set on top of a baking sheet to catch any drippings. If you’re using a broiler, cook the pork belly on the middle rack. If you’re not using a broiler, cook the belly on the second-to-top rack. Roast until the skin begins to crisp up and bubble, 15 to 30 minutes if using a broiler and 40 to 50 minutes if just using the oven. Keep an eye on the skin to make sure it does not burn. If parts of the skin begin to get too dark, rotate the pork in the oven so that it cooks more evenly.
Step 8
Take the pork belly out of the oven and remove it from its aluminum foil tray. Let it cool down completely before cutting into it, about 1 hour. Flip the pork belly over, skin side down, and slice into 1-inch pieces. Serve immediately, with English mustard as a dipping sauce.

"Sweet and Sour Fish","Seafood,Fresh Ginger,Mirin,Rice Wine,Scallion,Sea Bass,Tomato Paste,White Vinegar,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 2 servings","For the Sauce
6
tablespoons white vinegar
3
tablespoons tomato paste
1½
tablespoons mirin
½
tablespoon soy sauce
1
bird’s-eye chile, seeded and finely minced
For the Fish
1
whole (1½-pound) striped sea bass (or white-fleshed fish), cleaned and gutted
½
cup michiu (Taiwanese rice wine) or cooking sake
2
scallions, chopped
1
(2-inch) piece fresh ginger, unpeeled and sliced
¼
cup plus ½ tablespoon thick sweet potato starch (see Tip) or cornstarch
3
cups olive oil
½
medium red bell pepper, halved, seeded and cut into 1-inch squares
½
medium yellow bell pepper, halved, seeded and cut into 1-inch squares
1
small cucumber, cut into 1-inch squares
½
small yellow onion, sliced
½
teaspoon fine sea salt
⅛
teaspoon white pepper

Chopped cilantro, for garnish","0 user ratings","45 minutes","Step 1
Make the sauce: In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup water with the vinegar, tomato paste, mirin, soy sauce and chile. Stir to combine; set aside.
Step 2
Prepare the fish: In a medium baking dish, place the sea bass and pour the rice wine over. Stuff the scallions and ginger into the belly of the fish and let rest for 20 minutes, turning occasionally.
Step 3
Discard the ginger, scallions and rice wine. Holding the knife at an angle, slice three parallel diagonal slashes crosswise on both sides of the fish, deep enough so that they reach the center bone. Next, slice three slashes lengthwise on both sides of the fish, creating a grid pattern.
Step 4
Put ¼ cup of the sweet potato starch on a plate. Press the fish into the starch until both sides are fully coated; rub the starch into the cuts.
Step 5
In a wok set over medium-high heat, heat the oil until it reaches 320 degrees on an instant-read thermometer. Shake off any excess starch on the fish. Slide in the fish and cook, flipping twice, until it’s crispy with a golden-brown crust, 5 to 7 minutes. To check if the fish is done, pierce the thickest part of the fish with a chopstick. If it slides right through, it’s done. Turn off the heat. Transfer the fish to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Safely discard the oil, reserving 1 tablespoon of the oil in the wok.
Step 6
Heat the wok over high and add the chopped red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, cucumber, onions, salt and white pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are vibrant and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour in the sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and rapidly simmer until the sauce is slightly thickened and the bell peppers are soft, 3 to 4 minutes.
Step 7
In a small bowl, whisk the remaining ½ tablespoon sweet potato starch with ½ tablespoon water to form a slurry. Immediately pour the slurry slowly into the wok, stirring so that it’s incorporated completely. The sauce will thicken and begin to glisten. Turn off the heat.
Step 8
Arrange the fried fish on a large rimmed serving plate and pour the sauce with the vegetables over the fish. Garnish with the cilantro; enjoy while hot.
Thick sweet potato starch is coarse, similar to panko bread crumbs but a bit finer. It will give the fish a particularly crispy, crunchy texture.

Put the onions and oil in a large frying pan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until the onions are golden brown and very soft.
Step 2
Meanwhile, put the eggs in a medium saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for 8 minutes, until hard-boiled. Drain the eggs and run under cold water until cool enough to handle. Next, tap each egg on the side of the sink until cracked all over, then peel under cold running water. Transfer the peeled eggs to a medium serving bowl. Coarsely mash the eggs with a fork.
Step 3
When the onions are caramelized, transfer them to the eggs with a slotted spoon, leaving most of the oil in the pan. Gently mix with your hands or a fork or spoon; you should still be able to distinguish the egg bits from the onions. Season generously with salt and pepper. If the mixture seems too dry, add a little oil from the pan. The mixture should stick together if pressed with your fingers, but should not be oily. Sprinkle with herbs before serving warm or at room temperature.

Step 3
In a medium saucepan, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Add the uncooked carrots, shallot, garlic and coriander; season generously with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until very fragrant, 2 minutes.
Step 4
Add the wine to the carrot mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until mostly evaporated, about 3 minutes.
Step 5
Stir the rice into the carrot mixture, reduce the heat to medium and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Add 1 cup warmed stock and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid is almost absorbed, about 3 minutes. Repeat 4 more times, adding warm liquid and stirring until absorbed.
Step 6
Once the rice is tender and creamy and all the stock has been absorbed, add the cheese and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter; stir vigorously to combine until the risotto feels silky, creamy, luxurious. Season the risotto to taste with salt and pepper.
Step 7
Divide risotto among shallow bowls or plates and top with the roasted carrots. Serve with additional chile crisp, for drizzling on top.

dried bay leaf

cups water or vegetable stock (store-bought or homemade), plus more if necessary
3

(9-gram) cubes vegan “chicken” bouillon (such as Edward & Sons Not-Chick’n Bouillon)
2
(10-gram) cubes vegetable bouillon (such as Knorr Vegetarian Vegetable Bouillon)

teaspoons coarse kosher salt
1
teaspoon ground cumin

1
lightly packed cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped, plus more for garnish
1
packed cup cilantro leaves and tender stems, finely chopped
1
medium Yukon Gold potato, diced
5
ounces fresh or frozen green peas (rinsed if frozen)

Homemade or store-bought fried matchstick potatoes (optional; see Tip), for garnish","13 user ratings","1½ hours","Step 1
Prepare the noodles: Toast the penne in a dry, shallow pan, without oil, over medium heat. (Be careful not to overcrowd the pan, or the noodles won’t toast evenly; separate into batches if necessary.) Using a spatula or tongs, move the penne back and forth so they toast on all sides, until they are just a shade shy of golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep stirring as the noodles continue to darken. Set aside.
Step 2
Make the peanut purée: In a blender, purée the peanuts and 1½ cups water, starting on low speed and increasing the speed as needed. Add another 1 cup water and blend until creamy. Set aside.
Step 3
Prepare the soup: Heat the oil in a 6-quart (or larger), heavy-bottomed pot over medium. Add the carrots, celery, onion, green bell pepper and bay leaf and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 5 to 10 minutes.
Step 4
Add the water or stock, peanut purée, garlic, serrano chile, both types of bouillon cubes, salt, cumin, dried quilquiña, locoto powder (if using) and nutritional yeast, plus half the parsley and half the cilantro. Stir until well mixed.
Step 5
Bring to a low boil while stirring constantly, so the peanut purée doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot. Continue to cook at a low boil, stirring frequently, for 7 minutes. (Keep an eye on the pot, as the soup can boil over quickly.) Add the potato and the toasted pasta then reduce the heat and let simmer until the potato is cooked through and the pasta is just tender, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring in the peas and the remaining parsley and cilantro halfway through. (The soup should have some body, but should not be as thick as a chowder. If necessary, add a little more water or vegetable stock to thin it to the desired consistency.) Discard the bay leaf.
Step 6
Serve the soup in bowls and top with the matchstick potatoes, if using, and parsley to taste, for a touch of brightness and color.
Quilquiña (also known as Bolivian coriander and papalo) is an aromatic herb with a taste akin to cilantro, but stronger. Locoto (also known as rocoto) powder is made from locoto chiles, which are fruity and more potent than jalapeños, ranging in heat level from cayenne to habanero. Quilquiña and locoto powder can be found in Latin markets or ordered from specialty grocers online.
To make matchstick potatoes, julienne 1 peeled russet potato and fry in ½ inch neutral oil over medium-high heat until golden brown and crisp, turning occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes. Dust with salt.

"Buttermilk Sugar Biscuits","American,Biscuit,Buttermilk,Sugar,Unsalted Butter,Breakfast,Brunch,Snack","Yield: 9 biscuits","1
cup/227 grams cold unsalted butter
3⅓
cups/425 grams all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
½
cup/100 grams granulated sugar
1
tablespoon baking powder
2½
teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) or 1¾ teaspoons fine sea salt
1¼
cups/300 grams cold buttermilk

Melted butter and flaky sea salt (both optional), for finishing","178 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
Heat oven to 375 degrees and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper or foil.
Step 2
Coarsely grate the butter onto a plate, then freeze until cold and hard, at least 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt. Add the butter to the dry ingredients. Using a spoon, toss together until all of the butter is coated with flour.
Step 3
Add half the buttermilk and toss with the spoon. When incorporated, add the rest of the buttermilk and gently toss again, without mashing together or overmixing, until the dry ingredients are lightly hydrated throughout. The mixture will be crumbly.
Step 4
Flour a clean surface and dump the mixture directly onto it. Using your hands, gently press the crumbs together and then use a floured rolling pin or empty wine bottle to roll the mass gently but firmly into a 1-inch-thick rectangle. Fold the dough in half: Using a bench scraper, lift the top half off the surface and fold it over the bottom half. This step may be crumbly and messy at first, but just go for it and fold what you can down from the top. Repeat this roll-and-fold motion 5 times, flouring the surface and dough as needed and using the bench scraper to straighten the edges as needed. The dough will come together as you roll it. Rotate the mixture after each fold to create a square.
Step 5
Build the final layer: Fold the dough in half one last time, then roll to about 1½ inches thick to create a 6-inch square, using the bench scraper to straighten out the edges.
Step 6
Using the bench scraper or a sharp knife, cut straight down into the square to create a 3-by-3 grid of 9 squares, then place them on your sheet pan, upside down if you’d like taller biscuits. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through, until risen, golden brown on top, and slightly pale on the sides. Don’t worry if a couple of the biscuits tip over or if melted butter pools underneath. Brush the tops with melted butter and sprinkle with flaky sea salt, if using.

In a large pot or Dutch oven, warm the oil over high heat. Add the onion, garlic and salt and cook, stirring, until the onion and garlic are softened and just starting to brown, 5 minutes. (Decrease the heat to medium-high if necessary to prevent scorching.)
Step 2
Decrease the heat to medium-high and add the chicken, rosemary, oregano, red-pepper flakes and several generous grinds of black pepper. Cook, breaking up the chicken into crumbles, until the meat starts to lose its translucent pinkness and is turning white, about 2 minutes. Add the potatoes and stir well to combine. Add the chicken broth and half the lemon juice, scraping up any browned bits on the bottom. Bring to a rolling boil and then lower the heat to maintain a very brisk simmer. Simmer until the potatoes are nearly tender, 15 minutes.
Step 3
Add the spinach and dill, to taste. Continue to simmer briskly until the potatoes are tender, about 5 minutes more. Taste and add some or all of the remaining lemon juice, as well as more salt and pepper, if desired. Serve in bowls topped with feta and crushed pita chips.

1
pound long noodles like pappardelle or fettuccine

Grated Parmesan, for serving","248 user ratings","About 1 hour","Step 1
Melt the butter in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium. Add the tomato paste, garlic, anchovies, red-pepper flakes and rosemary. Stir until the tomato paste is a shade darker and sticking to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 4 minutes. If you have some white wine open, add ½ cup and simmer until nearly all evaporated, 2 to 4 minutes.
Step 2
Add the chicken and tomatoes and season generously with salt. If using whole tomatoes, break them up with your spoon. It may not seem like a lot of liquid, but the chicken will give off juices in time. Bring to a boil over medium-high, then reduce heat to gently simmer over medium-low until the chicken’s cooked through and the sauce is flavorful, 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Step 4
When the chicken is ready, turn off the heat under the sauce. Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente. Reserve 1 cup pasta water, then drain the pasta. While the pasta’s cooking, remove the rosemary from the sauce. Using two forks, shred the chicken right in the pot. Taste and adjust with salt. Return to medium-low to keep warm and thicken slightly until the pasta is ready. (Some chicken is so juicy that the sauce might seem thin; just simmer it until it’s thickened.)
Step 5
Add the pasta to the sauce and toss assertively over medium-high until the pasta is well coated. Add pasta water as needed to help the sauce cling to the pasta. Serve with grated Parmesan on top.

2
tablespoons fish sauce, plus more to taste
14 to 16
ounces dried rice noodles (¼-inch wide)

Bean sprouts and fresh basil leaves, for serving

Lime wedges, hoisin and Sriracha, for serving","50 user ratings","1 hour 20 minutes","Step 1
Trim the brown root ends off the onions, but keep the clean part of the root intact. Quarter the onions lengthwise with their skins on and through the roots so the wedges stay connected. Trim the stems off the cilantro and tie with kitchen string; save the leaves with tender stems for serving. Trim and reserve both ends of the jalapeño; thinly slice the remaining chile and save for serving.
Step 2
Toast the star anise, cloves, cinnamon and peppercorns in a large pot over medium heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Place the onions, ginger and reserved jalapeño ends in the pot, raise the heat to medium-high and char, turning occasionally, until evenly charred, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to the spice bowl.
Step 3
Add the chicken, 1 tablespoon salt and 6 cups water to the pot and raise the heat to high. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a steady simmer. Skim off and discard the foam and dirty bits on the surface.
Step 4
Add the spices and charred vegetables to the pot, along with the sugar, fish sauce and cilantro stems. Cover almost all the way and simmer gently on the lowest heat setting possible until the chicken is cooked through, about 35 minutes.
Step 5
Using tongs, transfer the chicken to a sieve and rinse under cold water to help keep the meat from turning gray and to make it cool enough to handle. Slip the meat off the bones and place the meat in a bowl (it’s OK if some meat remains on the bones). Return the bones and skin to the broth. When it returns to a simmer, taste and add more fish sauce or salt if needed. The broth should be intensely flavorful, bordering on salty, because the rice noodles will temper its savoriness. To prepare this dish ahead, you can strain the broth and refrigerate it and the chicken meat in separate containers for up to 5 days.
Step 6
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until pliable but not soft all the way through, about a minute less than the package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water until cool, then return to the pot. Add the chicken meat and pour in the broth through a sieve. Bring to a boil over high heat, then divide among serving bowls. Top with the bean sprouts, basil and cilantro sprigs and serve with the lime wedges, jalapeño slices, hoisin and Sriracha for seasoning to taste.

½
teaspoon Chinkiang (black) vinegar or balsamic vinegar
¼
teaspoon ground white or black pepper
¼
cup chopped cilantro leaves (optional)","221 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Prepare the chicken rice: Mix the soy sauce, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil, sugar, pepper and scallion whites in a large bowl. Slice the chicken alongside the bone, cutting off 2 pieces of meat per thigh. Cut those pieces into 1 ½-inch chunks and add to the bowl, along with the 4 thigh bones that still have some meat on them. Mix well to coat, then cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes and up to 1 day.
Step 2
Rinse the rice in a strainer until the water runs clear. Spread in a large clay pot, a Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet with a lid and add 2 cups hot tap water. Let stand for 15 minutes.
Step 3
Meanwhile, prepare the serving sauce: In a small bowl, stir the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, vinegar and pepper until the sugar dissolves.
Step 4
Spread the chicken with its marinade in an even layer over the rice, nestling the bones into the rice. Scatter the lop cheong evenly over the chicken. Cover and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to the lowest setting and continue cooking until the chicken and rice are cooked through, 25 to 35 minutes. Taste a grain of rice to see if it’s tender and cut into a piece of chicken to make sure it has lost its pinkness.
Step 5
Uncover the pot and raise the heat to high. Cook until you hear the rice crackling against the bottom and smell its toastiness, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.
Step 6
To serve, drizzle a spoonful of the serving sauce over the chicken and gently fold into the rice without scraping up the bottom. Sprinkle with the scallion greens and cilantro, if using, and serve with the remaining sauce. After most of the dish has been eaten, use a thin spatula to scrape up the charred rice on the bottom. It comes off more easily after the pot has cooled a bit.

cup/20 grams unsweetened finely shredded coconut flakes","317 user ratings","2 hours","Step 1
In a small bowl, combine milk, yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar. Stir together and set aside for 10 minutes to allow yeast to activate. In a bigger bowl, combine flour, salt, baking powder, cardamom (if using) and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar. Once the yeast mixture is foamy, add to the flour mixture, along with 1 beaten egg and 3 tablespoons of the melted butter. Knead in the bowl until a sticky dough forms, about 5 minutes, adding more flour as needed if the dough is too sticky. Lightly grease dough with 1 teaspoon melted butter. Cover with a clean dish towel and let it rise at room temperature for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
Step 2
Grease a round 9-inch springform pan using the remaining 1 tablespoon butter; heat the oven to 350 degrees. Grab chilled cheese wedges and cut 30 pieces of cheese (about ½ teaspoon each). Once the dough has doubled in size, cut the dough into two equal portions. Take one half of the dough and roll it out into a thick rope. Cut the rope crosswise into 15 equal sections. Take one of the cut pieces of dough, roll it into a ball then flatten it into a disk and place 1 piece of cream cheese in the middle. Pinch the dough closed at the top and roll it into a ball using the palms of your hands. Once it’s round, place it into the greased pan, arranging it with its smoothest side up, and repeat the process with the remaining dough. Make sure the balls of dough are equally spaced out, and allow the dough to rise, covered, for 15 minutes.
Step 3
After the second rise, brush the dough with an egg wash of the remaining egg beaten with a splash of whole milk, then bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
Step 4
When the rolls have finished baking, take them out of the oven and drizzle condensed milk on top. Finish off with a sprinkle of coconut flakes. Enjoy warm. Rooti farmaajo can last 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.

Make the soor: Into a medium saucepan with a lid, pour 3 cups of cold water and add the salt. Turn your heat to medium-high and whisk in your cornmeal slowly to reduce lumps. Cook, whisking constantly, until the soor thickens, about 8 minutes. Cover the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 25 more minutes, stirring occasionally, until thick. If the soor is sticking to the bottom, stir in ¼ cup of water. Set aside, covered.

Cocoa powder (optional), to garnish","83 user ratings","25 minutes, plus chilling and freezing","Step 1
Line a 9-by-5-inch inch loaf pan with 2 crossed strips of plastic wrap that hang generously over all 4 sides.
Step 2
Add the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, espresso powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt to a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to whip the mixture to soft peaks.
Step 3
Scoop about 2 cups of the cream mixture into the loaf pan and smooth into an even layer.
Step 4
Scoop a heaping tablespoon of cream onto one side of each wafer cookie and layer them tightly into the loaf pan from one long side of the pan to the other, creating 3 to 4 rows of about 10 cookies each. (The cookies should be standing upright on their round edges, so when you cut into the finished cake crosswise, you’ll get a nice striped pattern.) You may also have a few extra cookies.
Step 5
Spoon the remaining cream over the top of the cookies, making sure to spread the cream all of the way to the edges of the pans. Tap the pan lightly on the counter to help the cream settle in between the cookies. If you have any cookies remaining, you can place them, flat in one layer, over the top of the cream.
Step 6
Wrap the cake tightly in the overhanging plastic wrap, press gently and refrigerate at least overnight and up to 2 days. Freeze for 1 hour before serving for easier slicing.
Step 7
When you are ready to serve, unwrap the top of the cake and turn it out upside-down onto a serving platter. Remove the plastic wrap and lightly drag a spoon over the cake in a decorative pattern. Dust with cocoa powder, if using. Slice crosswise and serve. Wipe the knife in between cuts for the tidiest slices. If the cake is slightly frozen, let it warm up a bit before serving. You can also scoop it from the pan with a spoon for more casual serving.

egg yolk
For the Filling
16
ounces/450 grams cream cheese, softened to room temperature
½
cup/100 grams granulated sugar

Finely grated zest of 2 lemons plus ¼ cup freshly squeezed juice

Pinch fine salt
2
large eggs","117 user ratings","1¼ hours, plus cooling","Step 1
Heat oven to 375 degrees.
Step 2
Make the crust: Combine the flour, confectioners' sugar, salt and lemon zest in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the steel blade; pulse a few times to combine. Scatter the cubed butter on top, then pulse until the butter is almost completely incorporated and the mixture is sandy. Add the egg yolk and pulse until incorporated. The dough should hold together easily. If not, pulse in up to 3 teaspoons of cold water, 1 teaspoon at a time. Alternatively, you can mix the dough in a large bowl, using your fingers or a pastry blender to mix the butter into the flour.
Step 3
Lightly butter a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom and press the dough mixture evenly on the bottom and up the sides of the pan using a lightly floured straight-sided measuring cup to help press the dough into the corners of the pan. (If you need to trim extra dough to make it level with the edge of the pan, reserve it to repair any cracks after the shell has baked.)
Step 4
Line the tart shell with a piece of aluminum foil, making sure to tuck it into the corners and over the edges. Set the tart shell on a baking sheet and bake the shell for 25 to 30 minutes or until the dough appears dry and lightly golden. If the dough puffs up while baking, gently press it back into the pan with an offset spatula or similar tool. Turn the oven down to 350 degrees. If necessary, repair any cracks with the remaining raw dough before filling.
Step 5
While the shell cools slightly, make the filling: Add the cream cheese, granulated sugar, lemon zest and salt to a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to whip the cream cheese mixture until smooth and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing until completely incorporated before adding the next, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, if needed. Add the lemon juice and mix until smooth. Tap the bowl on the counter a few times then stir a few times with a rubber spatula to release any large air bubbles.
Step 6
Pour the mixture into the warm crust, smooth the top and carefully transfer the pan, still on the baking sheet, into the oven. Bake until just set around the edges and slightly wiggly in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.
Step 7
Let the tart cool to room temperature, then transfer to the refrigerator to cool completely. Remove the outer ring and slice with a warm knife, wiping the knife with a towel in between cuts for the tidiest slices. Serve cold or at room temperature. This keeps well in the fridge, covered for a few days.

"Chicago Thin-Crust (Tavern-Style) Pizza With Sausage and Giardiniera","American,Pizza And Calzones,Italian Sausage,Mozzarella,Parmesan,Party,Pecorino Romano,Pizza Dough,Plan Ahead,Project,Dinner,Main Course","Yield: 2 (14-inch) pizzas","For Each Pizza
¾
cup mild or hot giardiniera (see Tips)

Semolina or cornmeal, for dusting
1
stretched, cured Chicago thin-crust (tavern-style) pizza dough skin
¾ to 1
cup pizza sauce for Chicago thin-crust, more or less to taste, or use store-bought pizza sauce
2
ounces finely shredded or powdered Pecorino Romano or Parmesan
8 to 12
ounces full-fat low-moisture mozzarella, shredded, more or less to taste (see Tips)
½
recipe (about 8 ounces) Chicago-style Italian sausage, or use store-bought (raw bulk sausage or raw cased sausage with casings removed)","253 user ratings","35 minutes, plus at least 3½ hours for the dough","Step 1
At least 45 minutes before baking, set a baking steel or stone (larger than 14 inches, see Tips) on an oven rack in the lower-middle position and heat the oven to 500 degrees. Drain excess oil from the giardiniera in a fine-mesh strainer, tossing to get as much off as possible. Discard the oil and set aside the giardiniera.
Step 2
When the oven is heated and you’re ready to bake, dust a pizza peel with semolina or cornmeal. Lift cured pizza skin with the parchment or butcher paper still attached. The top (exposed) side will be drier than the underside. Place the pizza skin on the peel with the drier side facing down (so the papered side faces up). Peel off the parchment paper or butcher paper and discard. Using a fork, poke the crust all over to prevent large bubbles from forming.
Step 3
Spread the sauce evenly over the entire surface of the pizza, all the way to the edges. Sprinkle with half the Romano or Parmesan. Spread the mozzarella evenly over the entire surface, spreading it all the way to the edges. Use your fingertips to dollop marble-size pieces of the raw sausage all over the pizza. Sprinkle with the giardiniera.
Step 4
Give the pizza peel a few shakes to make sure the pizza is still loose (if it sticks at all, using a metal spatula or pizza peel to loosen it), then transfer the pizza to the heated baking steel or stone. Bake until the pizza is as done as you like it. (If you like yours browned and bubbly in the center and lightly charred at the edges, that’ll be about 10 minutes, depending on your oven.) You can use a metal pizza peel to lift the edges of the pizza and peek underneath as it bakes to ensure the bottom is done to your liking.
Step 5
Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and sprinkle immediately with the remaining Romano or Parmesan. Allow to rest for 3 minutes, cut into 1½- to 2-inch squares, and serve immediately. Let the oven reheat for at least 10 minutes before baking subsequent pizzas.
This style of pizza works best with minimal toppings–two to three items max. Sausage and giardiniera is a classic combination in the Chicago area. I like using J.P. Graziano hot giardiniera, which is available by mail order.
Do not use Italian-style (fresh) mozzarella for this pizza. If you cannot find full-fat low-moisture mozzarella, use a combination of widely available part-skim low-moisture mozzarella and shredded Monterey Jack. The cheeses will melt better if you grate them yourself, but pre-shredded can be used in a pinch.
If you do not have a baking stone or steel at least 14 inches square, 12-inch pizzas can also be baked on smaller stones or on the back of a large overturned aluminum sheet tray set on an oven rack while the oven heats. Follow the recipe for 12-inch pizza dough balls as outlined in the Tip for the Chicago thin-crust (tavern-style) pizza dough.

"Chicago Thin-Crust (Tavern-Style) Pizza Dough","American,Pizza And Calzones,Bread Flour,Dough,Instant Yeast,Make Ahead,Plan Ahead,Project","Yield: 2 (14-inch) crusts","300
grams bread flour (about 2¼ cups, see Tips)
7
grams sugar (about 1½ teaspoons)
7

1
gram instant yeast (about ¼ teaspoon)
150
grams cold water (150 milliliters, about ⅔ cup)
30
grams neutral oil, such as light olive oil, vegetable oil or corn oil

Semolina or cornmeal, for dusting","249 user ratings","30 minutes, plus at least 3 hours’ and up to 5 days’ resting","Step 1
Make the dough: Combine the flour, sugar, salt and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer (see Tips). Whisk together to combine, then add the water and oil. Mix at low speed with the dough hook attachment, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, until the dough comes together in a shaggy ball. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Mix on medium-low speed until the dough is silky and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, about 5 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface.
Step 2
Divide the dough: Using a bench scraper or knife, cut the dough into two even pieces, about 250 grams each. Using lightly floured hands, shape each piece into a smooth ball, then lightly coat each with oil, using your hands to cover every surface. Transfer each ball to a quart-size zipper-lock bag or other sealable container at least three times its volume. (Quart-size plastic deli containers also work for this.)
Step 3
Ferment the dough: For good results, let the dough rest at room temperature until doubled in volume, about 3 hours. For better results, refrigerate the dough overnight. For best results, refrigerate the dough for at least 3 and up to 5 days.
Step 4
The day before baking, roll the dough: Transfer one dough ball to a work surface generously dusted with semolina or cornmeal. (Refrigerated dough can be rolled straight out of the fridge, though allowing it to rest covered for 1 hour at room temperature will make rolling easier.) Using a rolling pin, roll the dough into a very thin circle 14 inches in diameter, lifting and rotating it occasionally (use a ruler or measuring tape to ensure the right size). Repeat with the second ball. If the dough feels like it keeps bouncing back as you try and stretch it, cover it with an inverted bowl or a clean kitchen towel, let it rest for half an hour, then try rolling again.
Step 5
Cure the dough: Transfer the doughs to a flat surface lined with parchment paper or butcher paper. Allow to rest uncovered at room temperature overnight. The top surface of the dough should end up dry to the touch with a leathery feel. If they puff at all during curing, you can push any bubbles with a fork and push them down to flatten them.
For this recipe, you’ll want an accurate baking scale and enough room to leave your stretched dough out at room temperature for a night. Using a scale to measure your ingredients is strongly advised here — at the very least for the flour. Going without can throw off the hydration level of your dough, and by extension, the success of your dough.
If you want to make 2 (12-inch) pizzas instead, use 225 grams flour, 5 grams sugar, 5 grams salt, 1 gram yeast, 115 grams cold water and 22.5 grams oil. Use only ¾ of the toppings.
The dough can also be made in a food processor or by hand. To make with a food processor, combine all the ingredients and process until the dough forms a ball that rides around the blades. Continue running the food processor for 30 seconds, then transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and continue as directed in Step 2.
To make by hand, combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, add the oil and water, and stir with a wooden spoon until a stiff, shaggy dough is formed. Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 10 minutes. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, 7 to 10 minutes. Proceed as directed in Step 2.

5
tablespoons/30 grams Dutch-process cocoa powder
¼
teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)
2
tablespoons chocolate sprinkles","724 user ratings","1 hour 30 minutes, plus cooling","Step 1
Make the cake: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt. Generously brush a 9-inch round cake pan with oil.
Step 2
In a blender or food processor, finely chop the carrots by pulsing about 6 to 10 times until minced. Add the sugar and pulse until just combined, about 30 seconds. Add the oil and eggs all at once. Pulse until the mixture is combined and looks a bit foamy, 30 seconds. (You can also do this step without a blender or food processor: Grate the carrots into a medium bowl using the fine side of a box grater. Add the sugar, eggs and oil, and use a whisk to combine.)
Step 3
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, and, using a whisk, mix until just combined. Gently mix in the sour cream and pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan. Bake until the sides pull away slightly from the edge of the tin and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 to 50 minutes.
Step 4
Move the cake to a baking rack set in a sheet pan and let it cool slightly in the pan, about 10 minutes. Invert the cake onto the baking rack and let cool completely.
Step 5
While the cake cools, make the brigadeiro topping: In a small saucepan, combine the sweetened condensed coconut milk, cocoa powder and salt. Stir with a whisk over medium-low heat until the cocoa powder is fully incorporated. Increase heat to medium and simmer, stirring frequently, until the mixture forms large bubbles and thickens, about 12 to 15 minutes. It should fully coat a heatproof rubber spatula and drizzle off in a slow stream. Remove from heat and allow the topping to cool completely, stirring frequently to prevent a skin forming on top, and until the brigadeiro topping streaks when stirred and is thick and fudgy, about 25 to 30 minutes.
Step 6
Spread the cooled topping over the cake, swirling the topping over the center and allowing it to drip over the edge. Let it set slightly, about 10 minutes, then shower a handful of chocolate sprinkles over the top. Cut the cake in wedges to serve.

cup/64 grams all-purpose flour
5
burrito-size (9-inch-wide) tortillas

Canola oil, as needed for frying

Basbaas Cagaar (Green Hot Sauce), for serving (optional)","83 user ratings","1 hour","Step 1
In a medium nonstick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the onion and cook until soft, stirring occasionally, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until soft, about 2 minutes. Next, add the beef and brown it, breaking down the bigger clumps of meat as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in cilantro, cumin, coriander and salt.
Step 2
In a small bowl, make a paste using the flour and ½ cup water. Next, cut each tortilla into 4 quarters, creating 20 triangular wedges. To make the tortilla pieces pliable, warm 6 or 7 pieces at a time in the microwave for about 10 seconds (or in the oven at 350 degrees).
Step 3
On a clean surface, grab one cut tortilla piece and position the round end closest to you. Form a cone shape by taking the tip at the bottom left and folding it up and over to meet the right edge slightly higher than its middle. Using your finger, brush a little flour paste over the top surface of the folded piece. Lift the bottom right tip of the tortilla and bring it up to cover the folded flap, creating a cone shape. Holding the cone in one hand, fill it with 2 tablespoons of beef filling. Tuck the inner flap to cover and seal in the filling, brush flour paste on the top surface covering the filling and then seal the sambuus by folding the top flap down and pressing to seal, creating a triangular shape. Use the flour paste to fill in gaps. Set on a baking sheet and repeat this process until all of the filling has been used.
Step 4
Pour ½ inch canola oil into a large, deep skillet and heat over medium-high. Once the oil is shimmering hot (you can flick in a small amount of the flour paste and see if it sputters), fry 4 to 6 sambuus at a time until golden brown and crispy, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer sambuus to a paper towel-lined plate to catch excess grease. Serve hot crispy sambuus right away, with hot sauce, if using.
Sambuus are best eaten right after frying, when they’re still hot and crisp. However, if making ahead, you can freeze the uncooked sambuus after assembly, then thaw and fry at your convenience. Frozen sambuus can last several months.

Any combination of chile sauce, rice or black vinegar, toasted sesame oil, white pepper, cilantro and MSG (optional, for serving)","191 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
In a medium bowl, use your hands or two forks to mix together the ground chicken, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, half the garlic, half the ginger, and the red-pepper flakes (if using).
Step 2
Heat your largest nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high until very hot. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil and the ground chicken, then use a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula to quickly press meat into a thin layer (like one giant smash burger). Cook, undisturbed, until meat is browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Break up meat into bite-size pieces and stir until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, then transfer the chicken to a clean bowl, leaving the juices and fat in the skillet.
Step 3
Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the scallion whites and the remaining ginger and garlic to the skillet. Raise heat to medium-high, scrape up browned bits on the skillet and stir until sizzling and light golden, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the rice, peas, the remaining 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and salt to taste. Stir to coat in the oil and break up clumps of rice. Spread out the rice along the sides and bottom of the skillet. Cook, undisturbed, until the sound shifts from a sizzle to a crackle and the rice is golden at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. If the rice is burning, add more oil.
Step 4
Pour the eggs in a thin stream over the rice. When you see some of the egg start to set, 15 to 30 seconds, toss the rice constantly to break up and cook the eggs. Add the chicken and toss to warm through, 1 minute. Turn off the heat and stir in the scallion greens. Serve with more soy sauce and other seasonings as you like.
Leftover, cooked rice from the fridge has less moisture, so it will crisp more easily. If you’re starting with uncooked rice, cook it as you would pasta so that the grains are not clumped together: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add 1⅓ cups rice and cook until just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes for white rice and 25 to 30 minutes for brown rice. Drain, run under cold water to cool, shake to get rid of any water, then spread out on a baking sheet and refrigerate until Step 4.

Bring a large pot of heavily salted water (about 2 tablespoons kosher salt to about 6 quarts water) to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook, occasionally stirring, until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.
Step 2
Meanwhile, trim the tops and bottoms off two of the Meyer lemons and slice into ¼-inch discs, discard any seeds, then very roughly chop into small pebbly pieces. Cut the remaining lemon into wedges for serving.
Step 3
In a large skillet or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the garlic, season with salt and cook, stirring, until softened, about 2 minutes. Stir in the chopped lemon pieces and ground fennel seeds, season again with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally until very soft, but not mushy 3 to 5 minutes.
Step 4
Pour in the cream, turn up the heat to medium, bring to a simmer, then add the cooked pasta and toss to coat with tongs. Add about ½ cup pasta liquid, toss again and cook, tossing often, until the sauce thickens but still pools a little at the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. If more sauce is desired, add a little more pasta liquid, toss again and continue cooking until the desired sauciness is reached. Turn off heat, season with salt and stir in dill (reserving some for serving on top)
Step 5
Serve the pasta while hot, sprinkled with reserved dill, freshly ground black pepper and lemon wedges, as desired.
If you cannot find Meyer lemons, regular lemons can work, but be sure to simmer the chopped pieces in salted water for 3 to 5 minutes or until most of the bitterness has gone away.

5
garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated
3
basil sprigs, plus ½ cup torn leaves
8
ounces angel hair pasta","39 user ratings","20 minutes","Step 1
Place a rack in the upper third of the oven and heat the broiler to high. On a foil-lined sheet pan, coat the salmon and tomatoes with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Arrange the salmon skin side up. Broil until the tomatoes are blistered and the salmon’s skin is crisp and flesh flakes easily with a fork, 6 to 10 minutes. Halfway through broiling, check on the sheet pan: If the tomatoes are burning, give them a stir. If the salmon skin is burning — congrats, you have a powerful broiler! — move the rack to the center of the oven and keep cooking.
Step 2
Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter over medium-high. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 3 cups water, 1½ teaspoons Diamond Crystal salt, the basil sprigs and a generous sprinkling of black pepper. Bring to a boil. Add the pasta, breaking the noodles in half if they don’t fit in the skillet. Cook over medium-high, tossing often with tongs or a fork, until the pasta is al dente, 5 to 8 minutes. It’s OK if the water isn’t completely absorbed, but if the skillet looks dry, without any liquid on the bottom of the skillet, add a few tablespoons of water. If the pasta is done before the salmon, remove from heat and cover to keep warm.
Step 3
When the salmon and tomatoes are out of the oven, transfer the salmon to plates, skin side up, to rest. Remove the basil sprigs from the pasta, then add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the pasta and toss until melted and glossing the noodles. Add the tomatoes, any juices from the sheet pan and the basil leaves to the pasta and stir just once to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve the salmon alongside the noodles.

2
tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
4
(6-ounce) thick white fish fillets, such as halibut or cod (skin on or off)","1170 user ratings","25 minutes","Step 1
Heat the oven to 400 degrees and set a rack in the upper part. In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, capers, pickles, herbs and Worcestershire sauce. Using a Microplane, finely grate the garlic into the bowl, then grate in the zest of the lemon. (Hold on to the lemon; you’ll use the juice later.) Stir to combine and season the tartar sauce to taste with salt and lots of pepper.
Step 2
In a small bowl, stir together the panko and olive oil; season with salt and pepper.
Step 3
Pat the fish dry on all sides and season lightly all over with salt and pepper. Transfer to a lightly greased or foil-lined sheet pan. Coat the top with a thin layer of the tartar sauce (a scant tablespoon per fillet). Sprinkle the panko evenly on top (about 2 tablespoons per fillet), pressing gently to adhere.
Step 4
Bake the fish on the top rack until almost cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes for fillets ½- to ¾-inch thick (though you should check earlier, if using a thinner fish). An instant-read thermometer should read 125 to 130 degrees when inserted into the thickest part of the fish.
Step 5
Meanwhile, add 1 tablespoon juice from the lemon to the tartar sauce and cut the remaining lemon into 4 wedges for serving.
Step 6
When the fish is nearly cooked through, switch the oven to broil. Broil the fish on the top rack until the bread crumbs are golden and the fish flakes easily and registers 140 degrees in the thickest part, 2 to 3 minutes. Eat with a spoonful of tartar sauce, more black pepper and a squeeze of lemon. (Any extra tartar sauce will keep for up to a week in the fridge.)

Kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal) and black pepper
5
ounces baby arugula
½
cup grated Pecorino Romano, plus more for serving

Flaky salt, for serving (optional)","1752 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Bring a large pot of well-salted water (2 heaping tablespoons kosher salt to about 7 quarts water) to a boil. Add pasta and cook until it is just under al dente, 1 minute less than package directions. Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, and drain the pasta.
Step 2
Meanwhile, make the sauce: Place the bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-low heat until crisp, stirring occasionally to make sure it does not burn, about 8 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside on a plate lined with paper towels. Turn heat to medium and add the tomatoes to the skillet, tossing them to coat in the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper. As the moisture from the tomatoes releases, scrape any browned bits that have accumulated at the bottom of the pan (add a few tablespoons of the pasta water if you need to) and continue to cook until the tomatoes begin to fall apart, about 5 to 7 minutes more. Add half of the cooked bacon back to the skillet and toss to combine.
Step 3
Increase the heat to medium-high and add the pasta directly to the skillet tossing to coat with the sauce. Add the arugula and ¼ cup of the pasta water, and carefully toss (you'll have a very full pan) until the arugula wilts. Add the cheese and another ¼ cup pasta water, and toss together until the cheese emulsifies and the pasta is glossy with sauce. If needed, add another ¼ cup pasta water to loosen the sauce.
Step 4
Serve in bowls and top with remaining bacon. Pass the grated Pecorino Romano at the table and season with flaky salt, if desired.

Heat oven to 425 degrees. Place salmon on a plate, skin side up. Using a sharp knife, make a cut into the skin about ⅛-inch deep, in 3 different places, making sure not to cut all the way through the flesh. In a medium bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons olive oil with the Cajun seasoning, paprika and 1 teaspoon salt. Pour over the salmon to coat it on both sides and set aside to marinate while you prepare the rest of the dish.
Step 2
To a rimmed sheet pan, add potatoes, 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste. Toss to coat and roast for about 15 minutes until tender. (Larger potatoes may take longer.)
Step 3
As potatoes roast, toss the asparagus with the garlic, the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper to taste.
Step 4
Move the potatoes to one end of the pan and place salmon skin side up next to them. Add asparagus in an even layer to the other end of the pan, and roast everything together for 10 to 13 minutes, until the asparagus is tender and the salmon is cooked to taste. If you’d like the skin to be crispy, you can transfer the vegetables from the pan to a serving platter and pop the fish under the broiler for 1 to 2 minutes. Serve hot.
The thicker the asparagus, the better, as the steam from the fish can make thinner asparagus soggy.

Line a plate with paper towels. Heat ⅛-inch canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Drop a piece of panko in: If it sizzles, the oil’s ready. Add a chicken cutlet (or two, if they can fit comfortably), and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to the paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with remaining chicken, adding and heating more oil as needed, and removing excess panko from the pan with a slotted spoon.

Serve chicken with more chives and lemon wedges for squeezing.
Freezing the chicken breasts for 15 minutes to firm them up will make slicing them through the middle easier.

Use a small knife to cut around the stem of the cabbage to release the base of the leaves; discard the core. Carefully peel off 12 leaves, taking care not to rip them. Set aside the remaining cabbage for later. Place the 12 leaves into the pot of boiling water and blanch for 2 minutes. Using tongs, remove the cabbage leaves and transfer to a large colander. Place in the sink under cold running water to cool down, then leave to strain.
Step 3
Once the onions are cooked, add the spices, walnuts and pine nuts and cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly toasted. Place a heatproof sieve over a small saucepan and strain the mixture, reserving the spiced butter. Transfer the strained onion mixture to a medium bowl; combine with the parsley and dill, then set aside.
Step 4
Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Finely slice about 4 cups of the remaining unblanched cabbage and place it in a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. To fill the cabbage rolls, place the blanched leaves on a chopping board, stem side up. Use a peeler or a small sharp knife to shave the stem along its length so that it’s no longer raised and is level with the leaf. Divide the onion mixture into 12 portions (about 2 tablespoons each). With the stem side of a cabbage leaf facing you, place one portion of filling in the center of each leaf so it’s perpendicular to the stem. Bring the base and then the sides into the center, then roll the cabbage leaves all the way up to seal. Place each roll into the baking dish, seam side down, then pour over the lemon juice, dot with the remaining ¼ cup plain butter and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon salt.
Step 5
Cover the dish tightly with foil and bake the cabbage rolls for 1 hour. Remove the foil then return to the oven for about 20 minutes more, until nicely browned. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.
Step 6
While the cabbage is cooling, add the sour cream to a small saucepan and heat over medium for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, to loosen and warm through. Don’t let it bubble at all; you don’t want it to split. At the same time, gently reheat the spiced butter in its saucepan until melted. Next, pour the sour cream into the cabbage roll dish; avoid pouring it directly on top of the rolls. Shake the dish gently to mix the sour cream in, then pour the spiced butter over the cabbage rolls. Sprinkle with the extra dill, season with a good grind of black pepper and serve directly from the baking dish.

Heat a large (12-inch) sauté pan or Dutch oven over medium-low, and add oil and onion; season lightly with salt and pepper. (The hot sauce added in Step 6 will add a lot of flavor, so be careful not to overseason here.) Let cook until the onions turn light beige in color and begin to caramelize, 20 to 25 minutes.
Step 2
Add garlic and cook until fragrant and starting to brown ever so slightly, about 2 minutes.
Step 3
Increase heat to medium-high and add bacon and ground beef, using the back of a large spoon to break up the meat into smaller pieces. Continue to cook until the liquid has mostly evaporated and the meat starts to sear and develop a crust on the bottom of the pan, 12 to 15 minutes.
Step 4
Remove pan from the heat and carefully drain off most of the fat, leaving a little in the pan to keep the meat moist.
Step 5
Return pan to medium-high heat and add white wine, allowing it to reduce until the mixture is almost dry, about 10 minutes.
Step 6
Add the chicken stock, heavy cream, hot sauce, paprika and bay leaf to the pan. Mix until combined and bring to a boil.
Step 7
Once the mixture is boiling, add the pasta and cook until al dente, stirring often, about 9 minutes.
Step 8
Reduce the heat to low and stir in both types of cheese, stirring until completely melted and sauce is thickened.
Step 9
Remove the pan from heat, stir in chives and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

Step 7
Divide the pasta among plates, sprinkling with any remaining pecorino and dolloping each serving with three spoonfuls of ricotta. Top with the parsley, which adds necessary freshness to counter the richness.

2
large avocados, cut into roughly ½-inch pieces
1
cup mint leaves, torn if large","220 user ratings","35 minutes","Step 1
Position a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 425 degrees. On a parchment-lined sheet pan, toss the torn pitas with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt.
Step 2
Finely grate the zest of 1 lime (about 1 teaspoon). In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir together the tahini, hot sauce, lime zest and cumin. At this point, you want it a tad too spicy, so add more hot sauce, if needed. Transfer ¼ cup of the spicy tahini to a large bowl, along with the ground chicken and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix with your hands to combine. Using oiled hands, form 12 meatballs (2 heaping tablespoons each) and place among the pita. (It’s OK if the pita is not in a single layer.) Roast on the bottom rack until the pita is well toasted and the chicken is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. Let cool slightly.
Step 3
While the meatballs and pitas roast, wash and dry the large bowl. To it, add the cucumbers, avocados and a big pinch of salt. Add ¼ cup lime juice from the zested lime and another lime; stir to coat and set aside. Add water to the remaining spicy tahini until it’s pourable. Season to taste with salt. (See? Not too spicy anymore.)
Step 4
Cut the remaining lime into wedges. Add the pitas, mint and remaining ¼ cup olive oil to the cucumbers and avocado. Stir gently to combine and season to taste with salt and lime juice. Eat the salad with the meatballs, a drizzle of the tahini, lime wedges and even more hot sauce, if you like.
You can use any hot sauce or paste you like, from harissa to Tapatío, but avoid those with a lot of vinegar, like Frank’s or Tabasco, which could make the dish too sour on top of the lime.

Cook on one side for about 2 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the pork starts to develop a nice caramelized color. Continue to cook, turning frequently, until caramelized on both sides and the meat is fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes total per batch. (If the pork seems to be browning too quickly, turn the heat down.)
Step 3
Transfer the cooked meat to a plate and repeat with the remaining pork. Serve hot, with fried rice, eggs and tomatoes.

Edible flowers (optional)
4
teaspoons Tajín

Flaky sea salt (such as Maldon), for sprinkling","24 user ratings","50 minutes","Step 1
Make the vinaigrette: In the jar of an immersion blender or in a standard blender, purée the avocado oil, lime juice, garlic, serrano chile, tajín and salt until smooth and emulsified. (Alternatively, combine the ingredients in a jar, cover and shake well to combine.) Set aside.
Step 2
Prepare the salad: Heat the pumpkin seeds in a small skillet over low, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly golden, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a small plate and set aside to cool.
Step 3
Using a sharp knife, trim the ends and peel off the brown skin from the jicama. Trim and peel the pineapple. Cut the jicama and pineapple lengthwise in half. Using a mandoline or a sharp chef’s knife, cut the jicama, pineapple and cucumbers into very thin slices (about 24 slices of jicama and 16 slices of pineapple). Using a sharp knife, remove the peel and pith from the oranges, then cut them into 8 slices each. Separate the leaves of the lettuce (you should have at least 20). Thinly slice the onion into rings and save the small ones from the center (save the remainder for another use). Thinly slice the serranos.
Step 4
Divide the jicama slices among 4 large plates, followed by the pineapple, cucumber and orange slices. Top with the lettuce leaves, then 2 or 3 red onion rings each, the toasted pepitas and serrano slices. Sprinkle with the herbs and flowers, if using, and finish with the tajín, a drizzle of dressing and some flaky salt at the end. (Alternatively, layer the ingredients on a large wide platter.) Serve any remaining dressing on the side.

½
cup grated Parmesan
½
cup grated mozzarella
2
tablespoons panko

Parsley, chopped, for garnish","944 user ratings","1 hour 15 minutes","Step 1
Sprinkle the chicken thighs with 1 teaspoon salt, then set aside. Meanwhile, in a wide pan or skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add the onion and cook, stirring, until softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and carrot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 20 seconds.
Step 2
Add the chicken and then the sake. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is no longer pink on the outside, about 5 minutes.
Step 3
Pour in the dashi; it should just cover the ingredients. Stir in the tonkotsu sauce and karashi and bring the liquid to a boil. Bring the heat back down to maintain a lively simmer, then stir in the butter and cook until the sauce’s liquid is slightly thickened , 30 to 35 minutes.
Step 4
Meanwhile, butter one 2-quart broiler-safe casserole dish or several ramekins. Heat the broiler with the rack 6 inches from the heat source.
Step 5
Stir the spinach into the pan. Taste the mixture and season with salt and pepper accordingly. Add the cooked rice to the prepared casserole and spread in an even layer. Spoon the chicken mixture evenly on top of the rice, then top with the Parmesan, mozzarella and panko.
Step 6
Broil the dish on high for at least 3 minutes, until cheese has melted and turned the shade of your preference. (But watch it to make sure it doesn’t burn.) Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately.
1⅔ cups raw short-grain rice will yield about 5 cups cooked. You can follow this recipe, using 1⅔ cups rice and 1⅔ cups water.

tablespoons rice vinegar
3
tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
½
teaspoon sambal oelek or sriracha

Sliced scallions (optional), for serving","692 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.
Step 2
Wrap the drained tofu in a clean kitchen towel or in a few layers of paper towels. Place on a plate and weigh down tofu with something heavy, like a glass bowl, skillet or can, and allow to drain for at least 10 minutes and up to 30 minutes.
Step 3
While the tofu drains, in a large, wide bowl, combine the potato starch, salt and pepper. Unwrap the tofu and pat dry once more. Cut the tofu into ¾-inch cubes and add to the potato starch mixture. Use your fingers to gently toss until coated.
Step 4
Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray. Place the tofu in the air fryer basket, shaking off any excess potato starch while transferring. Once the tofu is in the air fryer basket, spray once more with the cooking spray to prevent clumping. Cook until tofu becomes slightly puffed, about 10 minutes. Use tongs to move tofu pieces around the basket. Continue to cook until lightly browned in some spots and crisped all around, about 10 minutes.
Step 5
Discard the potato starch from the large bowl, wipe it clean and set it aside. While the tofu cooks, make the sauce: In a small skillet, combine the brown sugar, vinegar and soy sauce over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly and clings lightly to the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the sambal.
Step 6
Return the crispy tofu to a large bowl. Pour the soy glaze over the tofu; toss to coat. Transfer to a serving plate and top with scallions, if using.

Place the bread on a sheet pan, drizzle with olive oil on both sides and toast under the broiler (flipping halfway through) until crisp and golden brown yet still slightly soft in the middle, about 5 minutes. Set aside. (Alternatively, you can toast the oiled bread in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.)
Step 2
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large (at least 12-inch) skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add the chopped bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until bacon is golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. Turn off heat. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Leave 4 tablespoons of fat in the pan and discard or save the rest.
Step 3
Turn the heat back on to medium-high, add the brussels sprouts, season with salt and pepper and arrange the brussels sprouts cut sides down. Cook, undisturbed, until well browned underneath, 3 to 5 minutes. Then shake the skillet and continue cooking, stirring frequently until the cores are tender, about 4 minutes more.

Turn the heat down to medium-low, slowly stir in ½ cup water, then the crushed tomatoes, garlic (if using), the red-pepper flakes and half of the bacon and stir well to combine. Cover and cook, stirring 2 to 3 times, until the sprouts are tender and the sauce smoky and rich, 10 to 15 minutes. If the mixture seems a bit thick, stir in more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Season the sauce with salt, if needed, and turn off the heat.
Step 5
Serve over the toasts; top with the reserved bacon, chopped parsley and grated cheese.

In a large Dutch oven, melt butter over medium. Add leeks and scallions, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until fragrant, 1 minute.
Step 2
Add the orzo, clam juice and 5 cups of water; mix well. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until orzo is just al dente, 6 to 7 minutes.

Step 4
While whisking the soup in the pot, slowly drizzle in the tempered egg mixture until well incorporated. Add the fish and poach over low heat. (The soup should be at a bare simmer, as boiling will cause the egg mixture to break and curdle.)

Stir together the beans, broth, olive oil, garlic and 1 teaspoon of the pepper in a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker. Cover and cook on low until the beans are tender, about 7 hours.
Step 2
Put the pancetta in a skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until the pork has rendered most of its fat and is deep golden brown and crunchy in spots, about 10 minutes. (You may need to lower the heat to medium-low and/or add a spoonful of water to keep the pork from scorching as the fat renders.)

Add the pork and its fat, the lemon juice and the pecorino into the beans in the slow cooker. Stir vigorously until the pecorino has completely melted and the sauce has become smooth and emulsified, lightly coating the back of a spoon. Taste and add more pepper if you like. Pass more pecorino and pepper at the table.
Beans should reach a simmer and cook until tender to be safe to eat. If your slow cooker does not reach a simmer on the low setting, increase the heat level to high, and ensure the beans cook at a simmer for at least 15 minutes at some point in the cooking process.

"Spaghettini With Bottarga and Colatura","Italian,Pastas,Fish Sauce,Spaghettini,Tomato Sauce,For One,Quick,Main Course","Yield: 1 serving","
Salt
3
ounces spaghettini (thin spaghetti)
3
tablespoons jarred yellow cherry tomato sauce, see Tip
½
ounce bottarga di muggine (cured grey mullet roe), finely grated (2½ tablespoons), see Tip
1½
teaspoons colatura di alici (anchovy extract), see Tip
1
large basil leaf, finely chopped
¼
small garlic clove, finely grated (optional)

Fresh lemon juice, to taste

Red-pepper flakes, to taste","392 user ratings","15 minutes","Step 1
Fill a pot with water and salt heavily. Bring to a boil over high heat and add the pasta.
Step 2
While the pasta is cooking, add the tomato sauce, bottarga, colatura, basil, garlic (if using), a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of red-pepper flakes to a large bowl. No need to stir.
Step 3
When the pasta is al dente, reserve ¼ cup pasta cooking water then drain the pasta. Add the hot pasta to the bowl with bottarga and mix well, tossing to coat. The bottarga will start to melt and create a creamy sauce, glossing and clinging to the strands. If the pasta seems very dry, add a little of the pasta water. Season to taste with additional lemon juice and red-pepper flakes, if desired. Serve immediately.
Jarred yellow cherry tomato sauce, bottarga di muggine (cured grey mullet roe) and colatura di alici may be purchased online and from Italian or gourmet groceries.
If you do not have colatura on hand, you may substitute ½ to 1 teaspoon Asian fish sauce. Because Asian fish sauce is stronger in flavor than colatura, be sure to taste and adjust as you go.
If you cannot find jarred yellow cherry tomato sauce, you may also take fresh yellow cherry tomatoes, dip them into boiling water with a slotted spoon for a few seconds, then plunge them into a bowl of ice water. Slip off the skins, crush the tomatoes lightly and remove the seeds. Note that yellow tomatoes have less acidity, so red tomatoes and red tomato sauce cannot be substituted.

Hot sauce, to serve","774 user ratings","40 minutes","Step 1
Make the grits: In a medium saucepan, heat the vegetable stock and 2 cups water over medium-high until boiling. Once boiling, slowly pour in the grits while whisking to reduce lumps. Once the grits come to a boil, reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, whisking frequently, until thickened, 5 to 8 minutes.
Step 2
Remove the pan from the stove. Season the grits with the pepper, then stir in the milk and cheese until the cheese melts. Season to taste with salt. Set aside and cover to keep warm.
Step 3
Meanwhile, make the greens: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high. Add the shallot and garlic, and cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the red-pepper flakes, collards and chard. Toss to combine until wilted, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt, add the vegetable stock and bring to a simmer.
Step 4
Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the greens are very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the vinegar, and season again to taste with salt and pepper. Divide the grits among plates and top with the greens and a dash of hot sauce.

10 to 12
ounces ramen or udon noodles, preferably fresh
3
tablespoons finely chopped chives","9798 user ratings","30 minutes","Step 1
In a medium heatproof bowl, stir together the red-pepper flakes, soy sauce and sesame oil. Set next to the stovetop.
Step 2
Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Meanwhile, in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium heat, cook the ½ cup oil, peanuts and orange rind, shaking the pan occasionally, until the peanuts are golden and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes. Immediately pour the contents of the skillet over the red-pepper mixture (be careful of splattering!) and set aside.
Step 3
Meanwhile, in the same skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon oil over medium-high. Add the chicken and press it down with a wooden spoon into a thin layer. Season with salt and a generous amount of black pepper and cook, without stirring, occasionally pressing the layer of chicken down, until the bottom is browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Break the chicken up into small pieces and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes more.
Step 4
While the chicken cooks, cook the noodles according to package directions, until chewy but not soft. Drain and toss with a bit of sesame oil.
Step 5
Remove and discard the orange rind from the chile oil. Off the heat, add enough chile oil to coat the chicken and stir, scraping up any browned bits from the pan. Add the noodles and toss, adding more chile oil to fully coat the noodles and chicken. (If you don't use all of the chile oil, you can store it in the refrigerator for 2 weeks in an airtight container.) Top with chives and serve at once.
