## Definitions and Acronym

#### NYTCcooking

NYTCooking is the acronym of [the New York Times Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/). It is a cooking website from the New York Times that have over 10,000 recipes for cuisines all over the world. 

## Data Sources

#### Sources

Our recipes are from [the New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/). They were collected by scraping the website using `get_recipe.R` script in the `R` folder.

The source was last accessed on April 15, 2023.

#### Data cleaning

Data was cleaned and processed accordingly to our project's requirements.  

## Data Collection and Update Process

In our project, we did not automate the data collection process (i.e., no new recipe is added even if it might be available on the source website). If you want to get new recipes, you can do so by simply running the scripts in the `get_recipe.R` script in the `R` folder.

## Architecture and Where to Start

To explore our functions, starting with the `R` folder is recommended.
